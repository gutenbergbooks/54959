<small>ALONE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was breaking above the sea line, and the
Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward
in meadows of gold.</p>

<p>The little boat, moving gently to the vast and tremorless
heaving of the sea, seemed abandoned in that
world where nothing moved save the swell, and, far
away, a frigate bird drifting south, dwindling and vanishing
at last, blotted out in the blue of the morning
sky.</p>

<p>The man in the stern of the boat lay as though he
were dead, his arm curled over a water breaker and his
head on his arm; but now, at the first touch of the sun,
he moved, sat up, and, clasping his head with both
hands, stared about him.</p>

<p>Heavens! What an awakening that was from
sleep, the absolute and profound sleep that follows on
disaster! In a moment, as though his mind had been
suddenly lit by a great flash of energy that had been
accumulating since he closed his eyes, he saw the whole
of the events of the last three days in their entirety; he
saw the past right back to his childhood, as men see it
in that supreme moment that comes to the drowning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and which lights recollection to its farther frontiers.</p>

<p>He saw the schooner <i>Cormorant</i> landing at Ginnis'
Wharf in Frisco, and he saw himself on board of it as
second mate, Harrod, the first mate, standing by the
weather rail, and Coxon, the skipper, just come on
board, wiping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief
before giving orders to cast off from the wharf
where the tall Cape Horners lay moored by the Russian
oil tanks, and the grain vessels by the great elevators
were filling with living wheat.</p>

<p>He saw the Golden Gate and towering Tamalpais
and the great Pacific, violent with the ruffling of the
west wind and rolling toward the coast, to burst in
eternal song on the beaches of California.</p>

<p>They were bound for Papeetong, away down near
the Low Archipelago, with a trade room well stocked
and plenty of copra in prospect.</p>

<p>The <i>Cormorant</i> was well found, well manned, and
Coxon was an A-1 schooner captain; everything promised
a prosperous voyage and a quick return, when on
the evening of the second day out Coxon had called
his second mate down to the saloon.</p>

<p>"Floyd," said he, "it's not for me to say a word to
the second mate against the first, but Harrod, though
he's the best chap in the world in some ways, has a
weak spot, and that's drink. You notice he never
touches anything, but there's no knowing how long he's
on that tack&mdash;it may last the voyage, it mayn't. Not
that he's any way out of the common when he's on
liquor, but it's never no good to have a man boozy out
of port, so, like a good chap, lead him off it if he seems
taken that way. He's my own brother-in-law, and as
good as they make 'em, else he wouldn't be aboard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
<i>Cormorant</i>. It's my ambition to break him of it, and
he's willing to be broke; still, the flesh is weak, as
you'll soon discover if you live long in this world and
knock against men&mdash;and there you are. A word to the
wise."</p>

<p>Coxon's own weakness was a violent temper&mdash;we all
have our weaknesses&mdash;and Floyd's was a happy-go-lucky
optimism that made him believe in all men. He
was only twenty-two, the son of a parson in Devonshire,
educated up to fifteen at Blundell's School, set
adrift in the world by the death of his father, and
choosing the sea, prompted by the master ambition of
his life, to be a sailor.</p>

<p>Harrod had run straight for the first week, and then
he had fallen. He would appear on deck slightly thick
of speech, and sometimes he had a stagger in his walk,
and he would repeat his remarks in an uncalled-for
way, and tend to turn quarrelsome at the least word.</p>

<p>They could not tell where he got the drink from,
nor did they know the fact that his condition was due
neither to rum or whisky, but to samshu.</p>

<p>Samshu is a horrible, treacly compound made by
the Chinese of the coast; it is not kept in a bottle, but
in a jar, and it is the last thing in the way of intoxicants.
Balloon Juice, Cape Smoke, Valley Tan vie
with each other in villainy, but Samshu is the worst.</p>

<p>It is very rarely found out of Canton and Shanghai,
and it had been brought on board the <i>Cormorant</i> by
the Chinese cook, who traded it to Harrod for money
and tobacco.</p>

<p>A gale had struck them, driving them some hundred
miles from their course, and when it had passed,
Harrod, one afternoon, under the influence of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
stuff, had gone into the hole where paint and varnish
were stored, carrying a light. A few minutes later
came a cry of fire. Coxon was the first man on deck.
He saw in a moment that there was no hope. The varnish
room was blazing like a torch, belching smoke
and sparks and jets of flame like a dragon, and just as
unapproachable.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but take to the boats.</p>

<p>The Kanaka crew and the Chinaman whose samshu
jar had done all this bundled into the longboat. Floyd
ought to have been with them, but he was held back
by the work of victualing and lowering the quarter boat,
and they shoved off without him, so the three officers
were left&mdash;Floyd, in the quarter-boat, and the skipper
and Harrod quarreling on deck. Coxon's temper
had overmastered him. He was the owner of the
<i>Cormorant</i>, and his whole fortune was in the trade on
board.</p>

<p>Floyd, hanging on with a boat hook, heard the shouting
and stamping of the men on deck. He tried to get
on board again to separate them, but the smoke drove
him back, the heat was terrific, and he cast off, rowing
round to the windward side in the hope of boarding
her there. As he passed round the stern he was just
in time to see the end of the tragedy, Coxon flinging
Harrod over the weather rail and following him into
the sea.</p>

<p>Neither of the two men appeared again, and the
reason was very obvious&mdash;the water was filled with
gray, flitting shadows. The tragedy of the burning
schooner had made its call through the depths of the
sea, and the sharks were assembling for the feast.
Floyd waited. The whole of this terrible business had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
left him numb and almost unmoved. Tragedy thrills
one most in the theater; on the real stage the imagination
becomes paralyzed before the actual.</p>

<p>He pushed away farther from the flaming schooner;
she was burning now like a torch, and volumes of
white smoke passed away to leeward on the wind.</p>

<p>The sun was setting, and the picture of the burning
ship against the glowing western sky would have been
unparalleled had there been eyes to see it as a picture.
Floyd, gazing at it, watched while the flames, half invisible,
like the ghosts of brightly spangled snakes, ran
up the masts. He saw the canvas wither away, and
then he watched her lurch as the seams opened to the
heat and dip her bowsprit in the sea.</p>

<p>She settled slowly, the sea boiling about her, and
then suddenly she plunged bow first and vanished.</p>

<p>In less than twenty seconds there was nothing to tell
that a vessel had been there with the exception of a
wreath of smoke dissolving in the blue of evening.</p>

<p>The upper limb of the sun had just passed beneath
the horizon, and in the momentary twilight before the
rush of the stars Floyd saw the longboat, far away,
and with sail hoisted to the wind.</p>

<p>Then the night came down, and at dawn next day the
longboat had vanished.</p>

<p>As he awoke from sleep now he saw all these pictures
vividly. Till the night before he had not slept at
all, and it was the return to normal conditions of his
brain refreshed by sleep that now gave him a full view
of his past and his position.</p>

<p>The quarter-boat possessed a mast and lugsail; he
had stepped the mast and hoisted the sail, which now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
hung limp and flicking to the warm, steadily blowing
wind.</p>

<p>He rose up, and, standing with one hand on the mast,
looked over the sea. North, south, east, and west it
lay blazing in the sunshine, with not a sign of sail or
wing on the dazzle and the blueness, an infinite world
of sky, an infinite world of water all flooded by the
living light of the great golden sun.</p>

<p>Floyd, having glanced about him, returned to his
former place in the stern of the boat and began to review
his stores; he had taken stock of them twice in the
last two days, but had you asked him now to give an
account of them he would have been at a loss to say
exactly how they stood.</p>

<p>The water breaker was his first consideration. It
was half full&mdash;enough to last him for six days, he reckoned.
There was a full bag of ship's bread, another
half full, some tins of potatoes, some tins of canned
meat, but no can opener, and a few tins of condensed
milk. So much for the provisions. There were also
in the boat the ship's papers and a japanned tin box
containing the ship's money. These Coxon had flung
in before the quarrel between him and Harrod had
broken out. There was nothing else at all with the
exception of a boat hook and a bailer.</p>

<p>He had in his pockets a knife and one of those tinder
boxes in which the flint strikes on a wheel, a pocket
handkerchief, a few loose matches, and a pipe and
some tobacco. It was American navy twist, and he
had nearly half a pound of it. It was the first thing he
found in his cabin on rushing down, and it was the only
thing he had taken away.</p>

<p>Having breakfasted off a biscuit and a bit of meat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
from one of the cans which he managed to haggle open
with his knife, he lit his pipe, brought the sheet aft,
and took the tiller. It did not matter in the least where
he steered, for Australia and China lay away to the
west, the whole continent of America to the east&mdash;both
were hopeless; the Low Archipelago lay to the south,
and the hope of an island was just as brilliant in any
given direction.</p>

<p>So he gave his sail to the wind, trusting in God.</p>

<p>As the morning wore on, the sea line became hung
with light, fleecy clouds that deepened the far-off blue
of the sea. This fringe of light cloud often hangs on
the skirts of the Trades. Steering, Floyd could hear
the tune of the water as it flapped on the boarding and
rippled in the wake. The breeze was not strong
enough to raise any sea, and the swell was scarcely
perceptible unless to the eye.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE ISLAND</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">About</span> an hour before noon Floyd, relinquishing
the tiller, stood up and, supporting himself by
the mast, looked around. Then, sheltering his eyes
with his hand, he fixed his gaze straight ahead.</p>

<p>The sea line at one point was broken, and the sky
just above the broken point had a curious and brilliant
paleness.</p>

<p>Once before he had seen a bit of sky like that, and
he guessed it at once to be the reflection cast upward
from a lagoon island.</p>

<p>The sight of it dried his lips and made the sweat
stand out on the palms of his hands; then, taking his
place again at the tiller, he resumed his course.</p>

<p>The boat was making about three knots, and he
reckoned that the island could not be more than ten
miles away. Were bad weather suddenly to spring on
him Pacific fashion, he might either be driven out of
reach of the shelter before him or sunk. But the wind
held fair and steady with no sign of squalls, and now,
when he looked again, he could see the palm-tree tops
raised high above the water, and&mdash;what was that&mdash;a
ship?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>The masts of a ship, all aslant, showed thready near
the palms. She was wrecked&mdash;of that there could be
no manner of doubt.</p>

<p>The shimmer of the sea cut off everything but the
palm tops, the palm stems, and the masts; they seemed
based on air.</p>

<p>In an hour, standing up again, Floyd made out the
whole position distinctly.</p>

<p>The island that lay before him was simply a huge
ring of coral clipping a lagoon a mile or more in diameter,
as he afterward discovered. It was not an
even ring; here and there it swelled out into great
spaces covered with palms and artus and hotoo trees.
Near the break in the reef for which he was now steering,
piled up on the coral literally high and dry, lay
the carcass of what had recently been a schooner of
some two hundred tons.</p>

<p>She must have been sent right up by some great lift
of the sea.</p>

<p>As he drew near he could see that the planking had
been literally stripped off her from a huge space reaching
from the stern post almost to midship; there was
no rudder; the sails, he thought, had either blown away
or flogged themselves to pieces, taking with them gaffs
and booms. Then he remembered that the masts, still
standing by some miracle, would certainly have snapped
like carrots had sail enough been on her to carry away
the spars like that. He could not tell. The thing
hypnotized him as he watched it, his hand on the tiller
and the opening of the reef before him.</p>

<p>Though the sea was as calm as the Pacific can ever
be, a steady surf was breaking on the reef. The boom
of it came to him now against the wind, and the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
heaved to the short sea made by the resistance of the
great coral breakwater.</p>

<p>It was like the bourdon note of an organ, and though
it swelled and sank it never ceased, for it was the tune
that ringed forever the whole four-mile circuit of the
atoll.</p>

<p>Then as he passed the coral piers and opened the
lagoon, the sound of the surf grew less loud and the
boat went on an even keel.</p>

<p>Before him lay the great blue pond, calm as a summer
lake; the shore surrounding it showed long beaches
of salt-white coral sand and great spaces of foliage;
palms and breadfruit, mammee apple bushes and cane,
colonies of trees all moving, gently pressed upon by the
warm trade wind, whose breath made violet meadows
on the broad lagoon.</p>

<p>It was the most extraordinary place in the world.</p>

<p>It had a touch of the ornamental, as though some
city more vast and wealthy and populous than any city
we know of had decreed this great space of water as a
pleasure lake, ordered the white of sand and green of
foliage, emerald of shallow water and blue of deep,
and then vanished, leaving its pleasure place to the
wastes of ocean.</p>

<p>The water at the opening of the lagoon was very
deep, but inside it shoaled rapidly, and Floyd, glancing
over the thwart, saw the white sand patches and coral
lumps of the lagoon floor almost as clearly as though
he were gliding over them through air.</p>

<p>He swept the circular beach with a glance, flung up
his hand to shade his eyes, and then with a shout put
the helm over and hauled the sheet to port.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Away on the beach to the right something flapped;
it was the sailcloth of a rudely made tent, and by the
tent, waving its arm, stood the figure of a man; by the
man, squatting on the beach sand, was another figure,
small and difficult to distinguish.</p>

<p>Floyd instantly connected these figures with the
wreck; they were evidently the remains of the shipwrecked
crew.</p>

<p>As he drew closer the man on the beach showed up
more clearly&mdash;a bronzed and bearded man in dubiously
white clothes, and the figure seated on the sand revealed
itself as a girl; she was almost as dark as the
man, and she was seated with her hands clasping her
knees.</p>

<p>He unstepped the mast and took to the sculls; a minute
later the stem of the boat was grinding the sand of
the beach, and Floyd was over the side helping to pull
her up.</p>

<p>Before they exchanged a word they pulled her up
sufficiently to keep her from drifting off with the outgoing
tide. It was easy to see they were sailors.</p>

<p>"She's all right," said the bearded man; "and where
in the name of everything have you come from?"</p>

<p>Floyd flung both hands on the shoulders of the other.
It was not till this moment that he had borne in on him
the frightful loneliness and the fate from which he had
escaped.</p>

<p>"I'd never hoped to see a living man again," said he.
"Never, never, never! You're real, aren't you? Don't
mind me. I'm half cracked; your fist&mdash;there&mdash;I'm
better now."</p>

<p>"Wrecked?" said the bearded man.</p>

<p>"Yes; wrecked, burned out. The <i>Cormorant</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the name, bound from Frisco to Papeetong; drink and
fire did for us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short. He had been staring at the girl.
She had shifted her position only slightly, and she was
looking at him with eyes that showed little interest and
less emotion&mdash;the eyes of a person who is gazing at
shapes in a fire or at some object a great distance off.</p>

<p>She was a Polynesian&mdash;a wonderfully pretty girl,
almost a child, honey-colored, with a string of scarlet
beads showing on her neck about the scanty garment
that covered her, and with a scarlet flower in her jet-black
hair.</p>

<p>It was a flower of the hibiscus that grew in profusion
in all the groves of the atoll.</p>

<p>"That's Isbel," said the bearded man. "Kanaka,
called after the place she came from. Isbel Island in
the Marshalls. I'm Schumer, trader and part owner
of the <i>Tonga</i>. There she is"&mdash;jerking his thumb at the
wreck. "Hove up in a gale a month ago; we've been
here a month; every man jack drowned but me and
Isbel. I've salved a bit of the cargo&mdash;foodstuffs and
suchlike. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Floyd."</p>

<p>"Well, that's as good as any other name in these
parts, anyhow."</p>

<p>He sat down on the sand near the girl, and Floyd
did likewise. Then Schumer, taking a pipe and some
tobacco from his pocket, began to smoke. He talked
all the time.</p>

<p>"We've rigged up a bit of a tent. Isbel prefers to
sleep out in the open. Kanaka. Not much between
them and beasts except the hide. Well, tell us about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
yourself. What's the name of the schooner did you
say was burned?"</p>

<p>Floyd told; told the whole story while Schumer listened,
smoking, lolling on his back and cutting in every
now and then with a question.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, when the other had finished, "that
lays over most yarns I've heard. And what's become
of that boatload of Kanakas, I wonder? Starved out
most likely. Good for you they took their hook; good
for me, too, for now we've got your boat, and a boat's
a handy thing. We can get across the lagoon easy, for
there's no getting round on foot beyond that clump of
cocoanuts on the shore edge there. There's a quarter
mile or so of broken coral all that way; razors ain't in
it beside broken coral. We can fish, too, and it may
be handy to have a boat if we sight a ship, though this
island is clean out of trade tracks. We were blown
two hundred miles from our course."</p>

<p>"What was your cargo?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>"Printed stuffs, tinware, and general trade; a missionary&mdash;he
was washed overboard&mdash;and several passenger
Kanakas under him. Isbel belonged to his lot.
She can talk English&mdash;can't you, Isbel?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the girl.</p>

<p>It was the first thing she had uttered, and Floyd noticed
the softness of her voice and the way she avoided
the "y," or rather the hardness of it, without breaking
the word or mutilating it.</p>

<p>"It was the storm of storms," said Schumer; "there
we were, running before it with scarcely a rag of canvas
set and every wave threatenin' to be our last, every
man jack on deck clinging to whatever he could hold
when the great smash came. I don't know how I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
escaped. Providence, mostlike&mdash;same with Isbel,
though I guess she's so little account she escaped the
way some did in the earthquake out in Java three years
ago. I saw a whole family flattened out under their
own roof and a basket of kittens saved. It's that way
things work in this world."</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, lying on his back on the sand&mdash;there
was shade here from the trees&mdash;"I'm jolly glad
you were saved. Good Lord, it's only coming on me
now, the whole business; it's just as if one had escaped
from the end of the world. It's not good to be drifting
about in a boat alone."</p>

<p>Schumer agreed.</p>

<p>Floyd had now taken stock of his new companion.
He was a powerfully built man with a bold and daring
face, a trifle hard, perhaps&mdash;hard certainly one would
say in striking a bargain; he was tanned by sun and
wind, and despite his name he spoke English like an
Englishman; sometimes the faintest trace of an American
accent was perceptible, and sometimes the inimitable
American cast of words lending color and picture
to his conversation.</p>

<p>Floyd liked him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, rising up, "let's go and have
a look at the old hulk; there's some more stuff worth
salving&mdash;not that if I had a derrick and more boats and
a ship to lade the stuff in I wouldn't salve the lot. By
the way, what did you bring off in that boat of yours?"</p>

<p>"There's some biscuits and canned stuff, and a tin
box with the ship's papers and some money&mdash;nothing
much."</p>

<p>"Money, did you say&mdash;how much?"</p>

<p>Floyd told him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>"Well," said Schumer, "money's not of any use to us
here&mdash;wish it was; all the same, it's worth having, for
there's no knowing the moment the door may be opened
for us to get out of here."</p>

<p>He led the way toward the wreck, Floyd and Isbel
following.</p>

<p>The coral islands of the Pacific may be roughly divided
into two classes: compound islands&mdash;that is to
say, islands made of solid land and surrounded by a
coral ring or breakwater, and simple islands or atolls&mdash;that
is, simple rings of coral inclosing lagoons.</p>

<p>Then we have occasionally a third variety, an atoll
island in whose lagoon one finds several islets.</p>

<p>This island that Floyd had struck was of the simple
variety; the lagoon was of an irregular form, circular
as a whole, yet here and there making bays in the coral.</p>

<p>The coral ring had four definite areas upon which
vegetation flourished; one might say that the ring inclosing
the lagoon consisted of four islands, each joined
to each by naked coral.</p>

<p>The <i>Tonga</i> had been lifted by one great heave of the
sea right onto the raw coral of the northern pier of the
reef. It was not so great a feat, after all, for the reef
was lower than elsewhere, and ships before this have
been lifted over atoll reefs and deposited upside down
in lagoons.</p>

<p>The <i>Tonga</i> was not upside down, but she was broken
fore and aft, and the fact that her masts were still
standing formed another incident in that category of
strange incidents&mdash;the story of the power of the sea.</p>

<p>The rudder had been plucked off and lay there like
a great barn door flung down on the coral; the pintles
were gone as though they had been torn from the wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
by forceps; the planking, as I have already said, was
stripped from the port side right to midships; she lay
with a list to port, and through the great gaping wound
where the ribs of the vessel showed like the ribs of a
half-devoured carcass, the contents of the trade room
and cabin could be seen half shed on the coral, half
still contained.</p>

<p>Bales of print, kegs and cases, burst boxes of canned
provisions, bird cages, trade gin, some cases of cheap
rifles destined for the King of Apaka, who was in revolt
against German rule, and who was anxiously
awaiting the consignment&mdash;these and twenty more varieties
of things lay there festering in the sun, watched
by the sea birds and blown upon by the wind.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," said Floyd, "what a spill!"</p>

<p>"It's just that," said Schumer, "and it's not good to
see so much stuff gone to waste, especially when one's
money has paid for it, or part paid for it. It wasn't
all my venture. There's a man at Sydney who's my
partner. Well, there's no use crying over spilled
goods; let's try and do what we can. Now you are
here we may be able to salve more of the stuff than I
had hoped. First thing is to get some of the perishables
under shade. The sun doesn't hurt rifles, but it
doesn't improve prints and provisions."</p>

<p>"I'll help," said Floyd; "anything's better than doing
nothing."</p>

<p>"Then come along, my son," replied Schumer.
"Claw hold of the other end of this case, and you, Isbel,
follow along with that mat of rice."</p>

<p>A few mats of rice had been among the cargo of the
<i>Tonga</i>, and though here on the island there was evidence
of an abundance of food, Schumer seemed to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
especial attention to the salving of provisions. Perhaps
with that keen brain of his, which had carried
him so far in life against tremendous odds, he foresaw
the time when these same provisions would be more
valuable as a trade asset than minted gold.</p>

<p>They worked for several hours, and then knocked
off and came back to where the tent was pitched.</p>

<p>Schumer proceeded to light a fire, while Floyd and
Isbel got together the things for supper.</p>

<p>Schumer the day before had managed to catch a
small turtle, and he now set to to grill some of the flesh.
He also boiled some water for coffee, and in half an
hour Floyd found himself before the best supper he
had ever sat down to.</p>

<p>"It's good for us there's water here," said Schumer,
when they had finished. "You see, if this island had
been a ring of coral hove up out of the sea there
wouldn't have been any natural water here, but it's not.
It's my belief it's more a ring of mountaintops just
showing with coral bridging between; anyhow, there's
lots of water&mdash;at least enough for us. Well, we'll take
your boat out in the morning and have a good look at
the lagoon, and see what we can find in those bays
over there. I've got some fishing tackle and we can
fish&mdash;shellfish makes good bait; there's no fishing of
any account to be had on the shore edge, but there's
big things to be done out in the lagoon."</p>

<p>He filled his pipe and lit it, and they smoked for a
while in silence. The sun was setting, and from the
great ring of coral came the sound of the surf, continuous,
dreamy and less loud to the ears of Floyd than
when he had first landed. In a little time he would not
hear it; or, rather, he would not notice; it was one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the conditions of life here, a part of the strangeness of
this strange place where perfect peace dwelt forever
ringed around by the murmur of the sea.</p>

<p>"See here," said Schumer, after a few minutes' silence;
"what about that money you said you had in the
boat?"</p>

<p>"You mean the ship's money and papers?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, they're in the boat still," said Floyd, rising up.</p>

<p>He went to the boat where she lay high and dry on
the sand, and took out the tin box.</p>

<p>He brought it back to where Schumer and Isbel were
sitting by the embers of the fire, and, taking his place
on the sand beside them, opened the box and took out
the bag of sovereigns.</p>

<p>He undid the string and poured the contents of the
bag onto the hard sand of the beach.</p>

<p>There were two hundred and ten sovereigns&mdash;as
they afterward counted&mdash;and the moon, which had just
pushed up its face over the eastern reef edge, lit the
pile which Floyd was now stirring with his finger, while
Schumer, who had drawn himself closer on his elbow,
looked on without a word. Isbel had drawn closer, too.</p>

<p>She had spoken very little as yet, and when she spoke
it was a pleasure to listen.</p>

<p>To attempt the reproduction of Polynesian speech is
fatal, and the authors who attempt it succeed in producing
only a disgusting form of pidgin English. It is impossible
to reproduce the inflections, the softness, the
timbre, the soul of it. It is equally impossible to reproduce
the infantile French of the West Indies.</p>

<p>Isbel's language was the human equivalent of the
language of the soft-voiced birds; more than that, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
missionary who had brought her up had guarded her
from the vile "savvee" and "um" and "allee same" that
foul the speech of the lower natives.</p>

<p>How much the missionary teaching had bent her
mind to Eastern ideals or influenced her nature it would
be impossible to say. There was a great deal of mystery
about Isbel, centuries and centuries of the unknown
and unrealized gazing from those eyes so dark and unfathomable.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, breaking the silence at last,
"that's a decent pile, and what are you going to do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's Coxon's," said Floyd, "and now he's dead
it will belong to his next of kin; he hadn't a wife and
family, so he told me, but he's sure to have relations."</p>

<p>"Every man has who dies worth a cent," said Schumer.
"Question is how are you to find them, and
whether they'll thank you if you do find them, or swear
that you've nailed half the boodle. You said the chap
that fired the schooner was Coxon's brother-in-law;
well, it 'pears to me you've suffered a good bit from his
relations already, and deserve some recompense. If I
were you I'd put those papers in the fire and the money
in your pocket&mdash;however, that's your affair, not mine."</p>

<p>Floyd put papers and money back in the tin box.</p>

<p>"I'll put them in the tent for the present," said he;
"there's lots of time to think over the matter, and little
chance enough to act in it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "you can do as you please
when the time comes&mdash;and I wish it would come. I'm
about sick of hanging here doing nothing. I'm going
to turn in. I sleep in the tent, and there's room for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
too. Isbel has made a wigwam in the bush&mdash;the boat's
all right; she's high above the level of the tide."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the great moon, swinging above
the island, showed nothing but the embers of the fire,
the trodden sand and the tent; the human beings whom
the Fates had brought together on this lost and lonely
spot had vanished, touched by sleep, just as men vanish
from the world when touched by Death.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE SECRET OF THE LAGOON</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Floyd</span> awoke shortly after sunup.</p>

<p>The gulls were shouting and flying against the
blaze of the sunrise, fleeting like snowflakes across the
blue sky beyond the reef opening, and fishing at the
pierheads.</p>

<p>When the great lagoon was emptying or filling to the
tide, the water at the pierheads went like a mill race;
at slack water it lay gently flowing to the swell of the
outside sea as now.</p>

<p>Floyd came from under the tent, glanced round him,
stretched himself, and then crossed the reef to the outer
beach, where the breakers were coming in&mdash;the eternal
breakers of the Pacific, leisurely, monotonous, rhythmical,
filling the air with their sound and spindrift, their
ozone and life.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more extraordinary than the contrast
between the inner beach and the outer beach of
the island. You stood now facing a great lake, calm
and colored with all the blues and greens of tropical
water that varies in depth, and now, crossing the reef,
you stood on the shore of a thunderous sea.</p>

<p>Floyd stripped himself of his clothes and went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the surf. When he had bathed and dried himself in
the sun, he returned to the camp, where he found Schumer
lighting the fire and Isbel preparing breakfast.
They greeted him and he fell to to help.</p>

<p>He felt for the moment gay; the brightness, the
sense of early morning, the sea breeze and the crying
gulls all raised his spirits to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>Even Schumer, older and unenthusiastic to everything
but trade, seemed more cheerful than usual.</p>

<p>"We'll take the boat now," said he, when breakfast
was finished, "and prospect the lagoon. We want to
get soundings, anyhow, in case a ship should come and
may want anchorage inside. This island isn't charted&mdash;at
least it's not on the British admiralty charts. I
have the <i>Tonga</i> charts in the tent, and they make it all
clear water from the spot where the hurricane took us
to three hundred miles south, and we didn't run more
than a hundred and fifty before we tripped over the
reef.</p>

<p>"South of the three-hundred-mile limit there's a
group of small islands, but they are not atolls. Now
we're clear out of trade tracks and unknown, though
you may be sure whalers have been here, for there's
nowhere in the Pacific that whalers haven't pushed
their noses, and whalers are useless to us. We don't
want any blubber tanks showing their dirty hulls here;
if they took us aboard they would drop us again at
any decent port till after, maybe, a three years' cruise,
and then they'd land us God knows where, crippled
with work and tuppence in our pockets. No, sir, if any
dirty whalers show their faces here they'll get bullets
before they get us on board. Well, come on and help
float the boat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>They got the boat off, and in a few minutes were
out in the lagoon, Isbel forward, Floyd at the sculls,
and Schumer in the stern sheets.</p>

<p>"There's breeze enough for the sail," said Schumer,
when they were a hundred yards or so out. "Shove the
mast up, and we'll take it easy. I want to have a full
look at the floor of this lagoon, and take my time
over it."</p>

<p>Floyd took in the sculls, and, helped by Isbel, who
seemed to have a good knowledge of boat craft, got the
mast stepped. Then they shook the sail out, and the
boat scarcely heeling to the gentle breeze, they made
straight across the stretch of water between them and
the northernmost beach.</p>

<p>The floor of the lagoon was not of equal depth;
near the break in the reef it was thirty-fathom water,
shoaling swiftly to ten and five. The whole western
half of the lagoon was three fathoms and under. At
several places in this shallow zone the coral floor rose
sharply and nearly reached the surface. It was necessary,
indeed, to unstep the mast and take to the sculls,
while Isbel, leaning over the bow, conned them.</p>

<p>The water was so clear that the shadow of the boat
showed hard on the sand patches; looking down, the
eye was held by a thousand things beautiful and strange.
Color dwells like a wizard in tropical and subtropical
waters; it seems inherent in those seas. Shells, fish, and
coral all are gorgeous, and more than gorgeous&mdash;exquisite.
Here seem to lie the remnants of a world
more beautiful than any world we know&mdash;the ruins of
a paradise.</p>

<p>Coral alone presents to us a whole world of art; its
colors and its forms are infinite, and the artists of Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
or Tokyo make nothing more beautiful than the million
art treasures eternally being formed in the depths and
the shallows of the sea. Not only in the Pacific, but
the Atlantic, not only in the Atlantic, but the Indian
Ocean, from three-fathom water to a mile deep the construction
of the beautiful is eternally in progress, unviewed
and almost unknown.</p>

<p>Floyd, resting on his oars now and then, looked over
into the luminous depths where flights of painted fish
passed, their shadows following them over the sand
patches and brain coral.</p>

<p>Here and there were streaks of dead and rotten
coral of a seaweed brown, and here and there veritable
gardens of color. Great shells moved about on the
sand patches, crabs scurried hither and thither, globe-shaped
jellyfish passed clear as glass, showing up for
the moment by reflected light, and then vanishing like
ghosts. Schumer, his battered old panama tilted back
to protect his neck from the sun, seemed absorbed in
the things below; he spoke scarcely a word, unless to
give direction to the rower; Isbel, heedless of the sun,
was equally absorbed. Always on the lookout for the
shoal water, she said nothing except to give the direction
"To the right," "To the left," and on the heaving
of a sudden rock up through the brilliant water, "Ah,
stop hard!"</p>

<p>The whole of this western part of the lagoon was
very difficult water; unless buoyed it would be utterly
unnavigable by a ship even of small tonnage.</p>

<p>Schumer, having explored the northernmost part of
this zone, gave directions to Floyd to pull farther
south.</p>

<p>They had scarcely entered this area when Floyd's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
attention became attracted to his companion. Schumer,
leaning over the side and holding the thwart with
his left hand, suddenly became rigid. The muscles of
his neck stood out stiff, and his hand seemed trying to
crush the wood of the thwart.</p>

<p>Then he turned with a great cry:</p>

<p>"Shell! Acres of shell&mdash;pearls! We've struck it!"
Floyd, as excited as Schumer, drew in his sculls and
looked over.</p>

<p>Fortune wears many cloaks, but her ugliest is formed
of oysters. As far as Floyd could see, to right, to left,
ahead, and astern, the floor of the lagoon was an oyster
bed; all beauty of coral had vanished, and the water
seemed deserted even by the colored fish that haunted
the deeper parts of the lagoon.</p>

<p>"Row on," said Schumer; "let's see how far it
stretches. It is the biggest find I ever expected to
strike. I fancied there might be shell, I was on the
lookout for shell, but it was only an idea of mine, and
now it's here, a fortune right in our hands."</p>

<p>Floyd got out the sculls and the boat moved south.</p>

<p>Schumer was right when he had said "acres of shell."
An hour's prospecting gave them the fact that the
whole southern area of this the western portion of the
lagoon was shell. There were three main beds with
coral between, millions and millions of oysters, tons
upon tons of shell, and no man could say the possibilities
in the way of pearls.</p>

<p>When they had finished prospecting they beached the
boat, and taking shelter from the sun under the shade
of a little grove of artus and pura trees, set to on the
provisions they had brought with them.</p>

<p>Right across the lagoon from where they sat they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
could see their camping place and the tent, the wreck,
and the opening in the reef all in the blue weather, and
beyond the opening in the reef a glimpse of the great
Pacific and the fringe of pearl-white clouds on the
horizon.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, as they finished their meal,
"the stuff is there right enough, and it only comes now
to the question of lifting it. We have no labor, or none
to speak of. Of course, we'll dredge and dive so as to
get as much samples as we can, but we want twenty
men on the work, and I don't see how we're to do it
without letting others into the secret. It's this way:
Some time or another a vessel is sure to happen along
here and take us off; well, if it does we must keep mum.
Our object will be to get to Frisco or Sydney, and there
get hold of some chap with money and form a little
syndicate. That'll water the profits considerable; he'll
want half at least. But there you are&mdash;what's to be
done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Floyd; "we can't move without labor,
and even that's no use without a ship. To rig an
expedition up at Frisco or Sydney will cost a lot, and
you may be sure any speculator who puts his money
into the thing will want to gobble most of the profits."</p>

<p>"Before we'd let him into the know we'd make him
sign a paper," said Schumer, "stating his acceptance of
our terms, and then we'd make him keep his bond with
a pistol to his head. I don't trust the law alone, but
the law backed by a derringer makes a pretty good
security."</p>

<p>As Schumer spoke, Floyd, who was watching his profile
cut hard against the sky, noticed for the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the flatness of the cheek bones and the relationship between
the nose and chin.</p>

<p>Schumer was a very quiet man in his speech and
manner, yet there was about him an assured confidence
speaking of great reserves of energy; and now for the
first time, as though the thought of being robbed of
his treasure had revealed it, there peeped out a new
man; something of the bird of prey showed in that profile,
something of the desperado found echo in his voice.</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, "there's no use in making plans
till we have something to go on. Let's settle on our
immediate business; we'll have to get oysters up and
rot them in the sun to see if there's any show of pearls,
and it seems to me that we are very well placed for
that. Suppose a ship comes into the lagoon; well, she
can't come within a mile of this beach on account of
the shoal water, and she won't be able to see our work.
I propose we stick to our old camp by the wreck, and
come here every day to work. We can leave Isbel on
guard at the camp, and if she sights a ship she can light
a fire to give us warning."</p>

<p>"That's sense," replied Schumer, who had become
himself again. "We can rot the oysters on the weather
side of the reef, and we'll set to work on the business
to-morrow morning. Let's get back now to the camp.
I'm going to fix up a dredge. Did I tell you I was a bit
of an engineer? I've had to be a bit of everything this
time or that. I once edited a paper and wrote it mostly,
from the poetry column to the produce. I guess I'd
have written books if my lines had been cast in quiet
waters. Trade has always kept me going, and here
where there's palm trees and blue water enough trade
turns up in oysters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>His eyes were fixed across the lagoon on the palms
near the wreck; the hawk-like look had vanished, and
he murmured half to himself the verse of Scheffel:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"<i>Zw&ouml;lf Palmen ragten am Meeresstrand<br />
Um eine alte Cisterne.</i>"
</p>

<p>It was "<i>Dun Tode Nah</i>" he was repeating, and
Floyd, who did not know the verse, knew the language.</p>

<p>"You speak German?" said he.</p>

<p>"My father was a German," replied Schumer. "I
speak four languages and half a dozen Polynesian dialects.
One has to. Well, shall we get back? There is
nothing more to be done here for the present."</p>

<small>SCHUMER'S STORY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> rowed back across the lagoon to the camp,
and there Schumer set to on the construction of
his dredge.</p>

<p>Floyd had suddenly found an object of interest on
the island almost as absorbing as the oyster bed, and
that object was Schumer.</p>

<p>Schumer had seemed to him at first a simple trader
bound up in trade, one of a class that swarms in the Pacific.
Bound up in trade he undoubtedly was, but there
was all the difference in the world between him and the
others of his class that Floyd had come across in his
wanderings.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hardest thing in the world to put one's
finger on is personality, or the power that tells in a
man's appearance, actions, and speech. Its essence
lies in complexity, and is born of all the multitudinous
attributes that form spirit.</p>

<p>Floyd watched Schumer working on the dredge, and
wondered at his ingenuity and power over metal and
wood. He had but little material to his hand&mdash;cask
hoops and old ironwork from the wreck, and so on&mdash;yet
he made the most of it, and did not grumble. He
explained the mechanism of the thing when he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
finished. He had set Isbel to work stitching the canvas
bag which was part of the dredge, and she sat mysterious
as a sphinx, working and listening to him as he
talked.</p>

<p>Then, later on, as they smoked after supper and
watched the stars break out over the lagoon, Schumer
went on talking, now of trade and the wild work he
had seen here and there in the Pacific.</p>

<p>He was vague, rarely giving the names of islands or
places, contenting himself with such wide terms as "It
was an island south of the Marshalls," or "It was down
in the Solomons." It was down in the Solomons that
he had got the scar on his arm which he showed to
Floyd.</p>

<p>"That's fifteen years old," said he; "it missed the
artery or I wouldn't be here now. I was only twenty
then and new to the islands, new to the sea also. I'd
taken passage in a big schooner; two hundred and fifty
tons she was, captained by a Yankee skipper, and
manned by the biggest crowd of rascals that ever sailed
out of Frisco to meet perdition.</p>

<p>"We put in at a big island southeast of Manahiki. I
went ashore with the old man, the first mate, and two
of the hands that could be trusted. We were all well
armed, and lucky for us we were.</p>

<p>"It was the bos'n who started the trouble&mdash;a big,
black-bearded chap, half Irish, quarter Scotch, with a
tar brush somewhere in his family. Not a good mixture
by any means.</p>

<p>"We hadn't been ashore ten minutes when this chap
took the schooner. There were no preliminaries. She
had a big brass swivel gun, and he turned it on the beach
and let fly. He'd loaded her with a bag of bullets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the first shot smashed the boat we'd landed in, smashed
the only canoes in the place, and tore up the sand as if
it had been plowed. Fortunately we had seen his game
and scattered, but two natives were killed, and the rest
took to the bush.</p>

<p>"So did we, and under cover of the leaves we
watched what was going on in the schooner.</p>

<p>"They seemed pretty satisfied with themselves. They
were sure against attack; they had smashed our boat
and the canoes, and they were pretty certain we
wouldn't try to board them by swimming, for the lagoon
was full of sharks. They brought up grog and
took to dancing on deck. Their object, of course, was
to get away with the schooner and all the trade on
board, change her name, and make for some port on
the South American coast, and sell schooner and cargo
and all. There was money aboard, too&mdash;the ship's
money and some coin of the old man's, and fifty British
sovereigns of my own hid in my bunk, though the beggars
did not guess that.</p>

<p>"Yes, they should have knocked the shackle off the
anchor chain and got to sea at once; they chose instead
to drink and dance, celebrating their victory. You see
they did not know whom they were dealing with.</p>

<p>"From where we lay we could have picked them off
like crows with our rifles. Of course, that would have
meant they would have gone below and hid, and then
at dark they'd have gone away. It would have sobered
them, too, and I did not want that.</p>

<p>"So we let them be, putting our trust in the bottle,
and we set to and made a raft with the help of some of
the natives who were hiding in the bush with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>"There was a little creek hidden from the schooner
by a cape of coconut and pandanus trees, and we made
the raft there, and a rotten raft it was; but it served our
purpose, and when dark came down we shoved off, us
four and two natives.</p>

<p>"The tide was with us; it was running out of the
lagoon. The natives had canoe paddles, but they
scarcely used them. Not a soul was on deck; they were
all in the saloon drinking, and the noise was worse than
a tavern on the Barbary Coast of a Saturday night.
They wouldn't have heard us coming alongside if we
had come blowing trumpets&mdash;which we didn't."</p>

<p>Schumer paused to refill and light his pipe. The lagoon
was now a sheet of stars, and not a sound came
but the murmur of the reef and the splash of a fish
jumping in the lagoon.</p>

<p>"We came alongside, and in a minute we were over
the rail&mdash;she had a low freeboard&mdash;every man of us.
We didn't trouble about the raft, and she went out to
sea on the tide.</p>

<p>"The saloon hatch was off, and there they were all
crowded like bees in a bottle fighting and playing cards
and drinking and smoking, and there as they sat we
began to plug them with our Winchesters. We got six
before the smoke of the firing hid them, and then we
fired into the smoke and stood by to down them as they
came up the companionway. They were plucky, but
mad with drink, and they had no arms to speak of.
One of them had a bottle in his hand, the only thing he
could find to fight with; when he tumbled over into the
lee scuppers he still held it unbroken, and I guess he
went before his Maker with it like that.</p>

<p>"We settled them all with the exception of the bos'n.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
He skulked below, and I went down to find him. The
saloon was clear of smoke and the swinging lamp was
burning; dead men were lying everywhere, but no bos'n.
He'd taken refuge in the old man's cabin and had barricaded
the door, so that I couldn't kick it in&mdash;only managed
to crack the paneling; so I began firing through it
with my revolver, and then out he came with two bullets
in him and a sheath knife in his hand.</p>

<p>"He gave me this cut before we had done with one
another.</p>

<p>"The upshot was that every man of them was given
his dose, and we took the schooner out of the lagoon, us
four, with four Kanakas who joined the ship, and we
had good luck all the rest of the voyage, though my arm
inflamed so that I nearly lost it.</p>

<p>"So you see a trader's life out here is not all trading;
one has to fight sometimes for what one gets, and to
keep what one gets."</p>

<p>Floyd could not help thinking that Schumer's part in
the recapture of the schooner had been more than he
had stated.</p>

<p>"What's made you take to trading out here?" he
asked. "You're a sailor, aren't you? At least I made
the guess yesterday that you were a sailor first and a
trader after."</p>

<p>"Yes, I began as a sailor. I served my two years
before these new topsail yards made reefing child's
work. I served in a Hamburg ship. What made me a
trader? Well, I suppose it was the common sense that
made me give up sailoring. I do not like hard manual
labor. As I told you before, it was on the cards that I
might have cast my lines in the newspaper world.
Books interest me, written books; the world interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
me, and I might have been the correspondent of newspapers.
I am a fair linguist, and I can write simple
English and picture fairly well what I see in words; yet
I am a trader. I do not know why I am a trader in the
least. It is the way of life that has come to me."</p>

<p>He ceased, and they sat in silence for a moment.</p>

<p>Floyd, looking round, saw that Isbel had vanished;
she had slipped off to bed somewhere in the bush&mdash;slipped
off like an animal. It was her characteristic that
she was one of the shipwrecked party, yet remained
apart. She helped in cooking and boat sailing and in
other ways; but she lived her own life as an animal
lives it, thinking her own thoughts, keeping her own
counsel, speaking little. There was nothing about her
of the childish and the light-hearted that stamps so
many Polynesians, which is not to say that she was
gloomy or too old for her years. She was just a creature
apart, and had always the air of a looker-on at a
game in which she helped, but which did not particularly
interest her.</p>

<p>"The girl's gone," said Floyd.</p>

<p>Schumer looked round.</p>

<p>"Crept off to sleep; she'll sleep anywhere&mdash;in a tree
or in the bush. I can't make out Kanakas. I've read a
lot of stuff written about them, but there's always
something behind that no one can get at. They are
right down good in a lot of ways, and right down bad
in others. Missionaries civilize them and varnish them
over, but there's always the Kanaka underneath; they
make Christians of them, but it's only on the outside.
Look at that girl&mdash;she's only a child, of course, but a
missionary has had the handling of her, and in the time
we've been here she has turned right in on herself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
gone back to her people, so to speak. She's not bad, but
she's a savage, and nothing will make a savage anything
else than a savage, except, maybe, on the outside."</p>

<p>"She seems pretty faithful and helps us all she can,"
said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's not bad," yawned Schumer; "and she's a
good deal of use in her way, and she's company of a
sort, same as a dog or a cat. Well, I'm going to
turn in."</p>

<p>He rose up and stretched himself, and looked at the
starlit lagoon.</p>

<p>"It's funny to think there's maybe a fortune in pearls
under all that," said he, "no knowing&mdash;but it will take
some getting."</p>

<p>"We'll get it if it's there," said Floyd.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>DREDGING</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> were up at dawn, and the fire was crackling
and the coffee heating before the sun had fully
shown itself over the eastern reef line.</p>

<p>Schumer had been able to salve cooking utensils and
some unbroken crockery ware from the <i>Tonga</i>, to say
nothing of knives and forks and spoons.</p>

<p>It seems a small matter, but a knife and a fork make
all the difference when one comes to food, even on an
island of the Pacific&mdash;a plate, too.</p>

<p>Condemned to eat with one's fingers and to share a
knife in common, one feeds, but one does not eat.</p>

<p>There was condensed milk for the coffee, ship's bread
and salt pork fried over the fire. Isbel had collected
some plantains; they went into the frying pan to help
the pork. She had also gathered some drupes from a
pandanus tree growing near the wreck, and served them
on a big leaf.</p>

<p>"There's a whole lot of seeds aboard somewhere,"
said Schumer, as they breakfasted; "onions and carrots
and so on; I must hunt for them, and when we have
time I'll see how they grow here. You can grow anything
on these islands. The soil's the best in the world;
maybe because of the gull guano. We'll want all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
native-grown food we can get here, if things turn out
as I expect, for we'll have to feed the labor we bring,
and natives aren't happy without the stuff they are used
to. Corned beef and spuds are all very well in their
way, but it's breadfruit and taro and plantains that are
the stand-by. Fortunately there seems lots. You see
all that dark-green stuff growing over there straight
across the lagoon&mdash;that's breadfruit; big trees, too,
and the coconuts aren't bad.</p>

<p>"When we get the labor we'll have a main camp over
by the fishing ground. I've been thinking it all out.
There's no natural water there, but I noticed yesterday
a big rain pond in the coral; it must have been cut out
by natives some time or another. The funny thing
about these ponds is that the water is saltish at high
tides, but gets fresh with the ebb. In some of the
islands the natives stock them with fish, salt-water fish
swimming in fresh.</p>

<p>"Then we have the fishing to fall back on, and the
lagoon is full. Yes, we are not badly placed as things
go."</p>

<p>They placed the dredge on board the boat and some
food for the midday meal, and pushed off, leaving Isbel
behind to look after the camp and keep an eye out for
ships. At the sight of a sail anywhere on the sea she
was to light the fire and make a smoke with green wood,
and she had a splendid lookout post, for the deck of
the <i>Tonga</i>, onto which she could easily climb, gave a
complete view of the horizon from all directions.</p>

<p>Then they rowed off, leaving her watching them, a
solitary figure on the beach.</p>

<p>"Seems she'll be a bit lonely," said Floyd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>"Not she," replied Schumer; "she'll be happy enough
alone, and she has lots to do between washing up and
keeping a lookout. Kanakas are never lonely; it's a
disease of civilization."</p>

<p>"You look upon these people as if they were animals,"
said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Which they are," replied Schumer&mdash;"animals
dressed in human skin."</p>

<p>Floyd said nothing. He was not a psychologist or a
philosopher, but a man of action; yet he gauged something
of the strange make-up of Schumer's mind.
Here was a man of keen intelligence, a quoter of Scheffel,
an appreciator of beauty, apparently a kindly individual,
but in some respects apparently hard beyond
belief, and in others apparently blind.</p>

<p>Floyd had some knowledge of the Polynesian natives,
he was gaining some knowledge of Schumer, and
he was to gain more knowledge of both&mdash;of the civilized
man and the savage and their respective worth.</p>

<p>They got to work in two-fathom water on the northern
edge of the great bed. They stripped for the business.
Both men were good swimmers and expert divers,
and the dredge did its work fairly well. They agreed
to take the diving business in half-hour tricks, one remaining
in the boat with a view to possible sharks,
though sharks were scarcely to be feared in that part
of the lagoon, and to keep the boat moving when the
dredge was in operation.</p>

<p>Floyd was the first to go down. At a depth of twelve
feet it was as bright almost as at the surface. The
water seemed to hold light in solution; glancing up, the
white-painted boat floating like a balloon above him
showed a tinge of rose; passing scraps of focus were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
spangled and sparkled over as though powdered with
jewel dust; his arm, newly immersed, was diamonded
by tiny beads of air. In this silent, brilliant world of
crystal and color one only wanted gills to find life in
perfection and fairyland in material form.</p>

<p>There were few fish here, but occasionally a colored
phantom would slow up, pause, and whisk off, fry would
pass like a flight of silver needles, and great jellyfish
quartered like melons and absolutely invisible till
glimpsed by reflected light.</p>

<p>All these things he noticed in his first submersion;
after that the labor of the business prevented him from
noticing anything much except the work on hand, cruel
and murderously hard work to the man unused to it.
The dredge was almost useless at first; it had to be
taken up and altered, then, as it was dragged along, he
followed it, helping it, picking up loose oysters and putting
them in the bag. He could only work for less than
half a minute at a time, coming up for a two minutes'
breathing spell, and as he worked he could feel now
and then what seemed a warm wind trying to blow him
aside as the wind blows thistledown. It was the swell
of the incoming tide.</p>

<p>They had arranged to work in half-hour tricks, but
they found this absolutely impossible; before the end of
the first twenty minutes Floyd confessed himself beaten
and Schumer took his place.</p>

<p>An hour before noon they knocked off. They had
taken a large quantity of oysters, despite the limited
means at their disposal, enough to sink the boat a strake
or two and give them an hour's work in unloading and
spreading their catch on the coral on the windward side
of the reef.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Then they took three hours' rest under the shade of
the trees. At sundown they had completed their day's
work, and they felt as though they had been laboring
for fifty years.</p>

<p>They had overdone it.</p>

<p>Though they had dived as little as possible during
the second half of the day's work, using the dredge as
much as they could, the work had nearly broken them,
owing to the sudden and tremendous strain put on their
lungs.</p>

<p>Schumer recognized the reason of their exhaustion.</p>

<p>"We should have broken ourselves to it by degrees,"
said he&mdash;"done a couple of hours' work instead of a
whole day's. We are fools. We didn't want to strip
the lagoon; we were only after a sample, and could
have taken a week over it. Well, we can take things
easy to-morrow."</p>

<p>They rowed back to the camp and found Isbel waiting
for them, and supper.</p>

<p>They had come back in low spirits, but after supper
and a cup of coffee the surprising thing happened&mdash;their
spirits jumped up as though under the influence
of alcohol. Prolonged strain in diving produces these
results&mdash;the tissues that have been starved or partly
starved of oxygen reabsorb it with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>They lay on the sand and smoked and talked, and
Floyd built castles and furnished them with his prospective
fortune.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, "we strike it rich&mdash;very rich&mdash;what
may we net out of this?"</p>

<p>"It all depends," said Schumer, "if this is a real
pearl lagoon; anything up to a hundred thousand, and
maybe more. Pearls are a disease, and the disease is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
more prevalent in some waters than others. I don't
know why, no one does. It may be the temperature or
the stuff the water holds in solution, it may be the breed
of the oyster; but there you have it. Every oyster
under the sun is a pearl oyster, at least may be capable
of growing pearls. I found a pearl once in an oyster
which I was eating in a restaurant in Hamburg. It
wasn't a big pearl, but it was a pearl. I sold it for
thirty marks. But one thing is sure, it's only in tropical
and subtropical waters that you find pearls of any account
or to any account. It's only in the tropics and
subtropics you find color and stuff that's rich and worth
having. The north&mdash;pah! What does it give us?
Iron and tin, wood, copper. It's the south where the
gold is, where the pearls are. Why, the very earth in
the south hides color and riches! Where are the diamond
mines? In Africa and Brazil. The ruby and
emerald mines? In Burma and Brazil and India. The
gold? California and Africa. The silver? Peru.
Look at the birds; there's not a colored bird in the
north that hasn't come from the south; look at the shells
and the corals, and the flowers and the people; look at
the sun. No, the south holds everything worth having
or seeing. You ask me what I would do if I were
rich? Well, I would not go north, or only for a while.
I'd stay in the south, fix my home somewhere not too
close to the equator, take an island in these seas, and
have it for my own."</p>

<p>"Can you buy islands?"</p>

<p>"You can buy land; one might buy a small island
from some of the governments, or rent it; but I'd
sooner have the most land in a big island than the whole
of a little one. Once you have got your grip on land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
you have power. Nothing else gives you so much
power; funny, that, isn't it? Money, you would say,
gives power. It only gives the power to buy or to meddle
in other people's affairs through paid agents. If
you have got your grip on the earth, and the things
that come out of it, and the people who live on it, you
have power; and power is the only thing worth having
in the world."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Floyd. "There's a lot of things
I'd sooner have."</p>

<p>"And what things may those be?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to have a good time and see other people
having a good time. I want to travel, not as the
mate of an old hooker like the <i>Cormorant</i>, but as a man
with money in his pocket and time to look around him.
I want to be able to buy things. I want to dress decently
and to marry some time or another and settle
down. I'm fond of horses, though I've never had the
chance to own one; and I'm fond of cricket, though
I've never touched a bat for years. I'm fond of a jolly
good dinner, and I'm fond of a good cigar. To get all
those things one wants money."</p>

<p>"And all those things come to you if you have
power," said Schumer. "It implies everything material,
and much more. It's the sense of it, the feeling
'I am the stronger man,' that gives the mind freedom
and ease to enjoy what money can bring. You are entirely
English; you want enjoyment and luxury without
foundation of strength."</p>

<p>"Oh, good heavens!" said Floyd, "I think we have a
pretty solid foundation of strength; we own half the
earth, and we hold it&mdash;why? Simply because we live
and let live. We don't try to grind people down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
what you call power. We give them power, liberty,
whatever you like to call it. Now you are a man who
has traveled, and so am I. Can you tell me any spot on
earth that a man may be really free in that's not under
the Union Jack or the Stars and Stripes? Take the
German colonies, the Dutch; haven't you always some
pesky official shoving his nose into your affairs? Take
the very port officers and customs, and it's the same all
through the country as well as on the coast. You can't
breathe in these places the same as you can where
there's a decent English or American administration.
I've heard foreigners wondering how it is we hold India&mdash;all
those hundreds of millions of natives under
the rule of a few thousand white men. As a matter of
fact, we don't hold it at all; it holds itself. A native
in Bombay is as free as a duke in Piccadilly; that's our
secret."</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"And at any moment," said he, "those very free natives
are ready to rise in their hundreds of millions and
cut your throats."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Floyd. "Men don't cut the
throats of their best friends."</p>

<p>Schumer yawned.</p>

<p>To argue with Schumer was like pressing against
India rubber&mdash;the pressure left no impression.</p>

<p>They talked for a while longer on indifferent subjects,
and then turned in under the shelter of the tent.</p>

<p>The night was almost windless, and the great southern
stars stood out like jewels crusting the whole dome
of the sky from sea edge to sea edge. The Milky Way,
like a vast band of white smoke cut by the terrific pit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of a coal sack, Canopus, and the Cross, filled the world
with the mystery of starlight.</p>

<p>Away out on the weather side of the reef near the
wreck, and clear in the starlight against the coral, was
seated a figure. It was Isbel. She had not yet turned
into whatever haunt she had in the bush, and with her
knees drawn up and clasped by her hands she was
watching the regular fall of the breakers.</p>

<p>The child seemed under the spell of the vast sea, an
atom in face of the infinite.</p>

<small>RISK OF WAR</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">"You</span> can't get pearls from oysters till the oysters are
rotten," said Schumer next morning, as they sat
after breakfast consulting on the day's work. "Of
course, you could take every individual fresh oyster and
hunt under its beard; but you know how an oyster sticks
to its shell even after it is opened, and you can fancy
the work it would be. Once they are decayed they are
mushy, and the work is easy though it's not pleasant.
But it's surprising how quick you get used to it. We
worked pretty hard yesterday, and I propose to take it
easy this morning, and then a bit later on I want to have
a regular overhaul of the saloon and trade room of the
old <i>Tonga</i>. We have cleared the way pretty well, but
I've been so busy catching stores in the bush that I've
never had time for an overhaul. You see there was
only Isbel and me to do the job. I expect the oysters
we laid out yesterday will be fit to work on to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You've done this pearl business before," said
Floyd.</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"I have helped in pearling, if that's what you mean,
but I have never had any luck. I once had my hand on
a fortune in pearls, but it did not come off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>"There was a French island in these seas, no matter
where&mdash;it wasn't a thousand miles from the Marquesas.
It was a double lagoon island, shaped like an
hourglass; no use to look at, not enough trees to give
any amount of copra. It had done a little business in
sandalwood in the old days, but that was all gone. But
the place wasn't deserted. There was an old Frenchman
in charge; he had rented it under the French government,
and he lived there with his two sons, and
seemed happy enough, though doing next to no trade.</p>

<p>"I was in the outer lagoon twice as supercargo of a
trading schooner; once we put in for water, and the
second time we called on the chance of picking up a
little copra. Lefarge was the old man's name, and he
was a great fisherman; said he lived there mostly for
the fishing and to have an easy life.</p>

<p>"Yet somehow he struck me as a man who would not
be content to spend his time fishing and sitting in the
sun, and his two boys struck me the same.</p>

<p>"When I wanted to explore the island and get round
by the reef to the main lagoon he said that was forbidden,
the natives held it taboo to white men, and so on.</p>

<p>"Then I began to suspect, and the only one thing I
could suspect was shell, and maybe pearls.</p>

<p>"The more I thought of it the more sure I was; but,
of course, I could do nothing; the place was his, and
whatever it held, and we were peaceful traders, not
pirates. So, when we had loaded with all the copra
he could give us, out we put, wishing him good health
and good luck in his fishing.</p>

<p>"Two days from the island we met a mail brigantine,
and she signaled us that war had been declared between
France and Germany, and our captain&mdash;Max Schuster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was his name&mdash;began to swear, for we were bound for
the Marquesas, which are French, and we'd have to
alter our course and lose consignments and trade, and
he sat down on a mooring bit, and cursed war and the
French till I took him by the arm and led him down the
saloon and explained what was in my mind.</p>

<p>"I told him of my suspicions about the island, and
he pricked up his ears. Then, when I had been talking
to him about ten minutes and explaining and arguing,
he suddenly took fire.</p>

<p>"It's surprising how a dull man will refuse to be convinced&mdash;<i>won't</i>
see, till all at once, when he does see,
he'll rush at what you show him harder than the best.</p>

<p>"Schuster, when he saw fully the advantage of his
position, little risk, and everything to gain, rushed up
on deck. In less than five minutes the schooner was
showing her tail to the Marquesas and making a long
board for the island.</p>

<p>"Our crew were mostly Swedes, Kanakas, and an
Irishman, and when they heard the news that Schuster
had to tell them they were his to a man. The French
were not much in favor just then; they had Noumea
tacked on to their name, and the ordinary sailor loves
a bit of a fight or any break in the monotony of sea life.
We had plenty of trade rifles, Albinis&mdash;not the best
sort of rifle, but good enough for us&mdash;and plenty of
ammunition.</p>

<p>"We lifted the island at dawn on the second day,
and were anchored in the lagoon a few hours later.</p>

<p>"Old Lefarge was on the beach tinkering a canoe.
He didn't seem surprised to see us come in with the
German flag flying at the peak, nor did his sons, who
came out of the frame house set back among the bushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
They thought we had sickness or something on board,
for they made no offer to put out to us. We lowered a
boat on the port side, which was the side away from
the beach, and got our men in and the rifles, and then
rowed ashore.</p>

<p>"When they saw us landing they took fright, but our
men covered them with their rifles, and Schuster and I
came up to the old man and his sons and told them that
war was declared, and that they were prisoners.</p>

<p>"They could do nothing, and they just gave in. We
had them taken on board the schooner, and then we
went to the frame house, and there, sure enough, in a
big safe, were the pearls. We had searched the prisoners
and taken their keys from them. The key of the
safe was among them, and we opened it easily. There
were twenty thousand pounds' worth of pearls, so we
judged.</p>

<p>"Schuster was a man who always held tight by the
law. I pointed out to him that since we were at war
with France all French property belonged to us by
rights, and that the best thing we could do was to land
the prisoners and take the pearls. We did not want
prisoners. I pointed out to him, also, that we were
acting in the nature of privateers, but without a letter
of marque, and that consequently our prize would go to
the government, and we would get nothing.</p>

<p>"I pointed out that since this was French property
it would be much better just to take it and be thankful,
and say nothing. He said that would be piracy."</p>

<p>"So it would," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it would; but what is war if not piracy
legalized? You have a letter of marque and you are a
privateer, you have none and you are a pirate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>"But even privateering has ceased," objected Floyd.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "if it has it ought to be renewed
in war time; it breeds fine men, as you English
ought to know, and it's every bit as legitimate as fighting
behind naval guns. However, Schuster thought different
about our case. He said he would take the whole
lot, prisoners and pearls, to the nearest German island,
and claim a share of the proceeds, and be within the
law.</p>

<p>"So off we set, and it took us nearly three weeks to
reach the island we were in search of, between head
winds and calms. When we got there it was getting on
for night, so we held off and on till morning, and when
the pilot came aboard we gave him news of the war,
and several canoes that had put out shot back to land
with it; so that when we entered the harbor the place
was decked with flags, and we were cheered right from
the harbor mouth to the quay."</p>

<p>Schumer paused for a light, and went on:</p>

<p>"We landed our prisoners and the pearls, and the
governor had laid a big spread for us, baked pig and
lager beer, and so on, and Schuster was in the middle
of a speech when the sound of a gun brought us all out
on the beach, and there, entering the harbor, was the
German cruiser of the station.</p>

<p>"The captain landed and asked us what we were doing
with the flags, and when we explained he told us
that there was no war, only a lying rumor. He had the
latest European news from San Francisco, and he gave
it to us.</p>

<p>"It was worth going through the whole of that business
to see Schuster's face. He said nothing, and the
governor said nothing, and it was fortunate they held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
their tongues, for the cruiser only waited four hours to
water and put off again.</p>

<p>"When she had gone the governor bundled old Lefarge
and his sons on board our schooner and the
pearls, and he gave us orders to take them back to their
island and dump them there, and he sent an armed
guard to see that it was done. He judged, and judged
rightly, that Lefarge would make no trouble afterward,
simply because he would not want to advertise the existence
of his island. He made them a present of a few
cases of California champagne and some cigars, and
old Lefarge was so glad to be out of the business and
get back his pearls that he insisted on opening the
champagne, and Schuster brought out some trade gin,
and they all got drunk.</p>

<p>"There was a big moon that night, and they enjoyed
themselves, Lefarge singing 'Deutschland, Deutschland
ber alles,' and the governor the 'Marseillaise.'</p>

<p>"Then they started fighting, and then they got sick.</p>

<p>"Men are strange things, once they let themselves
go, and they are all pretty much alike when they are
drunk."</p>

<p>"You took them back to their island?" said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Yes, and then we had to return and bring back the
armed guard. Schuster lost nearly two months over
the business, to say nothing of the provisions and loss
of trade. He said he wanted to sink the mail brigantine
that had given us the lie; but you can't sink a ship
by wanting to. Well, let's get to work."</p>

<p>They rose up and crossed the coral to the wreck.
She was lying at a slant that made it just possible to
walk her decks without holding on to anything; her
copper was already dull green, and the barnacles, long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
dead, showed up like bosses on the copper green like
it, as though the verdigris had invaded them. The sun
had boiled out the pitch of the planking, and the decks
were warping, the planks bursting up from the dowels.</p>

<p>The great "dunch" she had received from the coral
in beaching had shaken everything loose; the bowsprit
had sprung up from the knightheads; all forward of
the great breach in her side the planking was loosened
from the ribs, and only wanted another storm to break
away and give the sea a clean sweep of the interior of
the hull.</p>

<p>But leaving aside the ravages of the sea, the work of
ruin was going steadily on under the influence of weather
and sun. A ship out of water is dead, and
death means corruption. On the reefs and beaches of
the ocean you will see wrecks, carcasses of ships, skeletons
with the blue sky showing through their ribs.
They have been eaten by the weather more than by the
sea.</p>

<p>They reached the deck of the <i>Tonga</i>, and made their
way down the companionway to the main cabin.</p>

<p>There was plenty of light through the broken sides
of the vessel, and the sunshine from the outside
world showed up the interior and was reflected by the
varnished pine paneling and by a strip of mirror still
absolutely intact. The table in the center was still
standing, and above it the swinging lamp all askew, an
empty bird cage lay in one corner, and all sorts of raffle
littered the floor.</p>

<p>The captain and chief mate's cabin lay aft, and Schumer,
opening the doors and fixing them so, began a
thorough overhaul of the contents. He had already
salved the ship's money and papers, the nautical instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ments,
charts, and books; what remained was mostly
private property, and there was not very much of it.
Some clothes, underwear, and boots and shoes made up
the pile, together with native curios, cheap novels,
some writing materials, and two revolvers with ammunition.</p>

<p>"It'll all come in handy some time or another," said
Schumer, "and I propose that we stuff the lot back into
the old man's cabin; they'll be as safe there as anywhere,
unless another big storm comes and makes a
clean sweep of everything. Now let's have another go
at the cargo."</p>

<p>They had no need to enter the hold by the main
hatch. The damaged side gave them ample means of
entry. The confusion was appalling.</p>

<p>Schumer had already salved a quantity of canned
stuff. Unable to move the boxes and crates, he had
broken them open with an ax and removed the contents
piecemeal; but, having only Isbel to help, and no
very urgent incentive to the work, he had done comparatively
little. Now, with the prospect of remaining
on the island and the necessity of feeding possible labor
when the time came for working the lagoon, it was a
different matter.</p>

<p>Floyd, however, did not see it in the same light as
Schumer, and when, after an hour's work carrying stuff
across the coral, they knocked off for a rest, he put his
ideas before the other.</p>

<p>"Look here," said he, "it's all very well breaking our
backs over this business, but we haven't got the labor
to feed yet; we'll have to go to Sydney or 'Frisco to get
the money raised, and it may be six months after we are
taken from here before we can get back, maybe longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Then the chap that finances this business will do the provisioning
of the expedition. I don't see the point in
harvesting this stuff under the trees, especially as it's
safe enough in the wreck."</p>

<p>"Now, see here," said Schumer, "if you are not prepared
for everything in this world you never get anywhere.
You say the stuff is safe enough on the wreck;
I say it isn't. First, there's the heat of the sun, which
doesn't improve it. Secondly, there's the chance of a
hurricane making a clean sweep of everything. The
tail end of a big storm landed her where she is; the
front end of another may finish her. You say that it
may take us six months or more before we can start on
our business&mdash;who knows? Who knows that a likely
ship may not call here with some man in charge of her
who would join us in the venture? I would sooner
have a decent shipowner in it than some American or
Australian financier. You never know what may occur,
and here is a lot of stuff that may save the situation
when the time comes. No, we have got to get it safe,
and get it safe we will, not only provisions, but as
much of the trade as we can manage. It's all money,
and you can do nothing without money, either in these
seas or in Europe. So we'll just stick to this business,
and we'll cover the cached lots over with sailcloth&mdash;we
have lots of that. We had better stick to it for a week
right on and get it over. I've been thinking about it
ever since this morning, and something tells me that
we'd be fools to bother about the lagoon, which is safe
as a bank, while the stuff that will help to raid that bank
is in danger."</p>

<p>"Suppose there are no pearls in those oysters of any
account?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>"There's always the shell," replied Schumer, "and
there are sure to be pearls. You are of the disbelieving
sort."</p>

<p>"Not a bit&mdash;only&mdash;well, perhaps you are right. I'm
not going to shirk any work that may be useful&mdash;and
when do you propose to examine those oysters we
fetched up yesterday?"</p>

<p>"I'll leave them a week," said Schumer; "the longer
they are left the more rotten they'll be, and the easier
to work. Besides, if we found no pearls, it would take
the heart out of us, and, more than that, the hope of
finding pearls when we do go will put the heart into us.
Nothing is better to make one work than a pleasant
prospect not quite assured in front of one. It's the
gambling instinct&mdash;a big instinct."</p>

<p>Floyd laughed. There was something about the
man Schumer that held him more and more and compelled
belief and the admiration that all men have for
strength and foresight. Schumer did a lot of thinking
as well as working. He had said nothing up to this
moment of abandoning the oyster business for a week
and putting all their energies into the salving of provisions
and trade&mdash;he had been thinking out the whole
plan in silence. He disliked the labor of the salvage
business as much as Floyd, but he imposed it on himself
as means to a distant end, and Floyd, though he did not
see the end in the same light as his companion, was not
the man to hold back when another was working.</p>

<p>"I am with you," said he. "It will give us exercise,
anyhow, and it's better than diving. Come on and let's
get at it."</p>

<p>He revenged himself by outvying Schumer in energy.
They worked stripped to the waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>They had set themselves a herculean task. It was
not only a question of conveying small goods piecemeal
in extemporized baskets; it was a business also of carrying
heavy stuff, bolts of cotton, and so forth that could
not be divided up.</p>

<p>There was not only the conveying to be done, but the
storing. In this nature helped them. The reef, or,
rather, the island that formed this part of the atoll had
a big sink in it amid the grove at the back of their encampment.
Schumer thought that in ancient days natives
must have made this hollow by artificial means
for some reason or other, possibly as a big rain pond,
though that supposition seemed negatived by the existence
of the natural well that lay in the western border
of the grove. However, it had been formed there.
It was almost a pit, a hundred yards long, shelving
toward the ends and densely protected by trees to seaward.
Schumer calculated that owing to this density of
vegetation and the fact of the ends having drainage
into the lagoon, this trench would not fill up, let the
rain come heavy as it might. On the fact that the
waves from the heaviest sea could not reach it he was
assured by the configuration of the outside reef.</p>

<p>He had fixed on a week's work, and at the end of
that time, though they had done much, they had not
done all; still, he seemed satisfied, as well he might be.</p>

<p>They had cached all the provisions, they had salved
a fair portion of the perishable trade, and covered this
portion of the salvage with sailcloth, and of all their
work this was the most laborious and trying. They had
removed the rifles, fifty in number, from their cases,
and stored them with the ammunition in a separate
cache; they had four navy revolvers of the Colt type,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
and these with the ammunition for them they kept in
the tent. Last, but not least, there was the liquor&mdash;cases
of trade gin, and a few cases of wine.</p>

<p>Schumer did not bother to cache these&mdash;he dealt
with them in another fashion.</p>

<p>"It's waste of money," said he, "but I have been
thinking it out. This square face is no use to man or
brute; it's only good to sell, and we have no customers
for it, and don't want them. It's dangerous stuff to
have about. The wine is different; there's not much
of it, and it may turn in useful, but the gin has to go."</p>

<p>He opened the cases, and they smashed the bottles,
heaving them on to the raw coral beyond the wreck, so
that the glass might not be in the way. The air stank
with the fumes of the filthy stuff while the smashing
went on. Isbel helped, the instinct for destruction that
lies in human nature, and especially in children, seemed
to have wakened up in her to its full.</p>

<p>She laughed over the work. Floyd had never seen
her laugh before, and as he looked at her shining eyes
and flashing teeth it seemed to him that despite all the
labors of the missionary here was an atom of fighting
and destructive force, useful for good or evil, and only
waiting on events for its development.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE BLACK PEARL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning they started for the oyster
ground. There had been strong winds blowing
for the last week and big seas tumbling along the reef,
the spray finding the oysters that they had put out on
the coral, otherwise they might not only have rotted,
but dried up. As it was, they were just in the prime
of their horribleness.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" said Floyd, as they set to work.
"This is worse than salving cargo&mdash;a jolly sight worse
even than diving."</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it," said Schumer, "and if it's
any comfort to you to know it's worse for me than you,
for I have an olfactory sense more acute than ordinary.
Get more to windward of your work. You ought to
know that as a sailor."</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" said Floyd, "these things must
have half stunned me; they are enough to make one
forget one's instincts, even. Go ahead, I won't complain."</p>

<p>He got to windward, and the stiff breeze helped matters
considerably. Schumer had brought a piece of
sailcloth, also a canvas bucket, which they filled as
required from a reef pool near by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>Every shell was searched and washed over the canvas,
Schumer, with the eye and hand of an expert,
doing the manipulation while Floyd poured the water
in trickles as required.</p>

<p>Dozen by dozen the shells were explored, drained of
their mushy contents, and flung away. Not a pearl
showed.</p>

<p>Floyd forgot everything in the excitement of the moment.
He had no longer a sense of smell, and then, as
the heap of shells steadily grew without sign or symptom
of what they were in search of, his spirits fell.</p>

<p>"Pour away," said Schumer; "this is only the beginning
of the business; there's no knowing what is to
come. Ah, here's something!"</p>

<p>He stood up, poured some water into the palm of his
hand, examined what was in his palm, and then held out
his dripping hand to Floyd.</p>

<p>In the palm lay a small black stone about the size of
a pea.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"Only a black pearl, worth maybe a hundred dollars.
But it's fortune, all the same. We have struck
it! A hundred dollars for half an hour's work for two
men. It's good!"</p>

<p>He sat down on the coral, while Floyd, now deeply
excited, took his seat beside him. The gulls cried and
wheeled overhead, and the sun burned on the blue sea
and the foam of the reef, and the wind blew the spray
in their faces as they sat handing their treasure from
one to the other, examining it and gloating over it.</p>

<p>Washed and dried now, its luster appeared. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a perfect black pearl, not large, but of splendid quality,
globular and slightly flattened on one side.</p>

<p>"It's worth more even than I thought at first," said
Schumer. "It's a beauty. Well, we mustn't chuckle too
soon; it may be the only pearl in the lagoon, though I
don't think so. And the shell is of fine quality; all the
indications are good."</p>

<p>"I thought all pearls were white," said Floyd. "Of
course, I know nothing about them, and the only ones I
have seen were in shop windows."</p>

<p>"And most likely false, at that," said Schumer.
"No. Pearls are not all white. I don't know what
makes the color in them, but there it is. Some are
black like this, and a few are pink, and I've seen some
gray&mdash;they aren't much good. Pink are the rarest,
then come black, then white. Well, I'll put this fellow
in my match box, and now let's get to work again."</p>

<p>He put the pearl in the match box and the box in the
pocket of his coat, which he had taken off. Then, having
placed a lump of coral on the coat to prevent any
chance of the wind blowing it about, they returned to
work.</p>

<p>They worked right through the whole take of shell,
and the sun was setting when they had finished. The
result was triumphant.</p>

<p>Twelve pearls was the harvest, including the black.
Four of these were quite inconsiderable, but of good
quality; four more, though larger, were not of good
shape or quality, but there were three white beauties.
The largest, Schumer estimated at a thousand dollars
and over, the next largest at less than a thousand, and
the third at five hundred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>There were also some seed pearls, tiny things like
nits' eggs.</p>

<p>"If the whole lagoon pays up like that," said Floyd,
"we'll be rich ten times over."</p>

<p>Schumer shook his head.</p>

<p>"We can't tell. Nothing is more uncertain than
pearling. We are sure to find blank streaks, and it's
possible we may have just struck the richest corner. In
a lagoon like this a lot depends on the different temperatures,
the depth, and the rush of the currents. But
we've done well, and a lot better than I expected."</p>

<p>They set off back across the lagoon to their camping
place, and the day's take was placed in the box with the
ship's money.</p>

<p>Schumer had suggested to Floyd that the money of
the <i>Cormorant</i> should be placed with that of the <i>Tonga</i>
in the same box, and Floyd had agreed, seeing the wisdom
of centralizing their treasure so that in eventualities
it might be more easily protected.</p>

<p>Together with the pearls the hoard made now a very
respectable show, though Floyd had pointed out that
the <i>Cormorant</i> money, being Coxon's, must not be
counted in their mutual assets. Schumer had agreed,
though evidently with reservations. The money of the
<i>Tonga</i> was a different matter; he seemed to look on it
as his own. Never once did he refer to it in other
terms, nor had he told Floyd the name of the <i>Tonga's</i>
skipper.</p>

<p>Floyd did not press the point&mdash;it was a matter entirely
to do with Schumer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE LAST OF THE WRECK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">That</span> night, as they sat by the camp fire they noticed
a great confusion among the gulls.</p>

<p>They seemed quarreling all along the western side
of the reef. The voice of the gulls was one of the familiar
sounds of the island, but not after dark. To-night
they were clamorous.</p>

<p>They broke out again before dawn, and Floyd, listening,
noticed a new note in their voices. They seemed
not quarreling one with another, but against some common
enemy. Then the sound died away little by little,
and when he came out of the tent there was not a gull
to be seen near the reef opening, where as a rule they
congregated in numbers.</p>

<p>The sunrise was clouded, and the sun did not strike
the sea till half an hour later than his ordinary time.
The wind that had been blowing so strongly yesterday
had died away, yet the boom of the surf on the reef
was louder than on the day before.</p>

<p>Floyd crossed the reef close to the wreck and looked
seaward.</p>

<p>A glacial calm held the sea, a calm underrun by a
tremendous swell. A long, tremendous swell, an infinite
heaving of the very depths of the ocean finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
expression here in acre-wide undulations, solemn, slow
to the eye, rhythmical and sonorous.</p>

<p>The beating of the breakers seemed ruled by a
metronome.</p>

<p>There was no little wave and big wave, no hesitation
of the sea. The breakers were equidistant and equal
in volume, and their pace was set to the same funeral
march.</p>

<p>Schumer came out of the tent, and, catching sight of
Floyd, walked toward him.</p>

<p>"There must be a lot of damp or electricity or something
in the air," said he. "I feel like a rag."</p>

<p>"Look at the sea," said Floyd; "there has been a big
storm somewhere, if I am not greatly mistaken."</p>

<p>Schumer stood looking at the sea.</p>

<p>The sun seemed bright as ever, yet the water did not
respond to his light; it had at once a surface brilliancy
and a dullness in its depths. Toward the shore it was
bottle green, and even the blue far out had a trace of
tourmaline.</p>

<p>Schumer said nothing, and turned away to the camping
place, where Isbel was making the fire.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on with the diving to-day?" asked
Floyd, as they breakfasted.</p>

<p>"I don't feel like work," said Schumer; "besides, I
doubt if it would be any use. There's a huge, big storm
coming, if I am not mistaken. I feel it in my skin, and
I feel it in my nerves. I suppose it's the electricity in
the air, but I believe I'd spark if you touched me with a
bit of metal. Listen! There go the gulls again."</p>

<p>Away on the reef beyond the fishing ground, so far
away that their voices came indistinctly on the windless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
air, the gulls were crying again, and, standing up,
Floyd could see them in wild flight about the reef like
scraps of blown white paper.</p>

<p>Then they rose higher, continued their argument,
and began to recede.</p>

<p>"They are off," said Floyd; "going out seaward, the
whole lot of them. By Jove, that looks like business!"</p>

<p>"They know what's coming," said Schumer, "and
they are clearing out of the track. Wonder what tells
them. Instinct, I suppose."</p>

<p>He set off to examine the cache, taking Floyd with
him. He had covered the perishable stuff with sailcloth,
and he now set to make the lashings more secure.
They worked an hour, and when they came out again
the sun had lost his brilliancy&mdash;a vague mist hid the
horizon on every side.</p>

<p>In the northwest this thickness seemed more dense,
and the sea, still glassing in and breaking in rhythmical
thunder on the reef, had turned to the color of lead.</p>

<p>But for the noise of the surf the silence was now
absolute and complete.</p>

<p>It held so till noon, when a wind began to stir the
palm tops; a wind that seemed to come from nowhere,
rocking them and tossing them hither and thither, making
cat's-paws on the lagoon, and flicking at the tent
canvas like a worrying hand.</p>

<p>Schumer took down the tent.</p>

<p>He had already placed the valuables in a place of
safety. He had dug out a hole beneath one of the trees
and buried the cash box containing the money and
pearls.</p>

<p>"You never know," he said, "if it's a cyclone that's
coming. Nothing is safe above ground. A cyclone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
would lift an anvil; anyhow, this will be safe enough."</p>

<p>An hour after noon the great storm showed itself.</p>

<p>Away above the northwestern horizon a black line
appeared, hard and distinct as the outline of a country.</p>

<p>It did not seem to advance&mdash;it rose. Till now it assumed
the appearance of a wall. As it rose, it lightened
to a dark copper color, and as it rose it lengthened,
so that now it occupied the whole horizon from
east to west.</p>

<p>The rapidity of this development was appalling, and
the sun, as if shrinking before the coming attack, paled
still more, dimmed as by a partial eclipse.</p>

<p>Now the wind came steady and strong, whipping the
lagoon and bending the foliage, and then all at once
dying away again into absolute stillness.</p>

<p>It was in this great pause that they heard a sound
never to be forgotten; less a sound than a vibration&mdash;deep
and almost musical, like the vibration of a great
glass rubbed by a wet finger.</p>

<p>Isbel, who had remained on the reef near the wreck
while the two men had gone for a moment toward the
lagoon edge, called out suddenly, and they turned and
came toward her.</p>

<p>Even as they turned, the first blast of the wind struck
them, and, battling against it, they reached where the
girl was crouching, pointing to the sea.</p>

<p>The sea beyond the limit of a mile or so was flat as a
board, beaten to a dead level by the coming wind and
white as frosted silver.</p>

<p>They did not wait to see more; turning, crouching,
running as swiftly as possible, and nearly lifted from
their feet, they made for the shelter of the grove. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
heard the coconuts torn from the palms striking the
sand, and Floyd had a momentary vision of nuts hitting
the lagoon like round shot fired by artillery, and then
the whole solid world seemed to smash like a ball of
glass, as the blaze of lightning and the concussion of
the first peal of thunder shook the island as a drum
skin is shaken by the stroke of the stick.</p>

<p>Floyd felt Isbel nestling close to him like a frightened
animal, and he put his arm round her to protect her.
He heard Schumer calling out something, but what he
could not tell. The wind had now followed on the
thunder in its fullest force, and it yelled.</p>

<p>No earthly sound could be compared to that ceaseless,
mad, devilish yell that seemed the expression of all
the ferocity of all the ferocious things that had ever
inhabited the earth.</p>

<p>It was enmity made vocal. The enmity of the infinite
and eternal.</p>

<p>And there was no rain. For a moment Floyd
thought that there was no rain; then, lying on his
stomach and crawling a bit forward, he saw the rain.
It was not falling, it was driving across the lagoon in
a great sheet upheld by the wind, and the lightning when
it struck again showed through a roof of water.</p>

<p>Then, the first rush of the wind slackening, the rain,
upheld no longer, came down with a roar.</p>

<p>"It's not a cyclone," Schumer shouted to Floyd;
"it's just a storm&mdash;the grandfather of all storms!"</p>

<p>His voice was cut off by the voice of the sea, that had
now added itself to the wind and the thunder.</p>

<p>The sea, no longer beaten flat, had risen in its might,
and was raiding the reef. The sound was like the roar
of a railway train in a tunnel. Something of the vibra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tion
reached them through the ground they were lying
on.</p>

<p>They were wet through, but safe. The grove had
weathered many a storm; the position of the trees and
their relationship to the reef rendered this spot an
impregnable stronghold.</p>

<p>Away on the opposite side of the lagoon breadfruit
trees were being broken down, but here not a tree went,
though the palms were bending like tandem whips and
the leaves being torn from the artus.</p>

<p>As time passed, the sea began to rise more and more,
while the face of the wind lost its first edge.</p>

<p>Toward evening the waves were making a clean
breach of the reef by the wreck, and when dark set in,
though the wind had lessened still more, the sea had
risen in an inverse proportion, and they guessed the
reason. The tide was flooding.</p>

<p>Then came new sounds. The wreck was going. The
bones of the <i>Tonga</i> were being crunched by the wolves
of the sea. They heard the noise of the tearing of
timber from timber, the roll and rumble of balks awash
on the coral, and then, worn out and huddled together
under a piece of canvas which they dragged from the
cache covering, they fell asleep, sure that the worst of
the business was over.</p>

<p>When they awoke, the sun was shining, but the wind
was still blowing half a gale. The fury of the storm
had been in its first impact, but the fury of the sea was
now even greater than during the night.</p>

<p>The waves were mountainous, and the reef where
the wreck had lain was unapproachable, but the sun
made up for everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>They crawled out and sat on the sand, drying themselves
in the sunshine, stiff and chill from the damp, and
feeling like people recovering from an illness.</p>

<p>"That storm has been traveling a great distance,"
said Schumer, "and we got only the butt end of it
That's what made it blow out so soon. A storm is like
a man&mdash;it has only a certain length of life, and the
farther it travels the more it loses in size. It doesn't
seem to lose in force, only in <i>size</i>.</p>

<p>"This big sea shows that a big track of the Pacific
has been stirred up. This sea will travel right down to
the Horn, and it will last for days here. Look at the
lagoon!"</p>

<p>The lagoon was strewn with wreckage, spars and
planking and ribs floated near the shore, moving as if
gently stirred by some giant's finger in the wind-whipped
water; the reef, as far as they could see, was
washed free of any trace of the wreck that had lain
there the day before.</p>

<p>"It's a good business we salved the stuff out of her,"
said Floyd. "Your business, too, that was, for if I had
been left to myself I wouldn't have troubled."</p>

<p>"I'll go and look at the stuff presently," said Schumer.
"I believe it won't have been hurt by the rain&mdash;at
least, the perishable stuff&mdash;I was too careful about
the packing; and the drainage is all right&mdash;people
rarely think of that. It doesn't do stuff any harm to be
rained on if it is properly covered; what does matter is
soaking. Yes, it's just as well we moved in time. Now
let us get to work."</p>

<p>A fire was impossible, as there was not a dry stick to
be found anywhere, so they breakfasted on canned meat
and biscuit, and then set to work to examine the cache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>There was two feet of water in the cache, all the rest
had run off to the lagoon by the drainage afforded at the
two ends. Schumer had packed the perishable goods on
top&mdash;they were quite unharmed. Having satisfied
themselves on this point, they returned to the beach and
the sea.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen still more, but the sea was still
furious.</p>

<p>"It will be less over there on the reef by the fishing
ground," said Schumer, "and we can begin again with
the diving work to-morrow!"</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>A WEEK'S WORK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day, though the sea still held, the wind had
fallen completely, and the lagoon, protected by
the reef, was calm, though heaving slightly to the impetus
from without.</p>

<p>All the water close to the reef opening was wreck
strewn, a section of deck floated like a raft, and they
had to exercise care in navigating the boat.</p>

<p>"If we had hands enough," said Schumer, "all that
stuff might come in useful to build a house with, or some
sort of shanty that would give more protection than the
tent. We'll want something in the rainy season. But
there is no use in bothering, we haven't the hands."</p>

<p>When they arrived at the fishing ground they landed
and found the heap of shells they had left scattered and
almost vanished.</p>

<p>"That will teach us in future," said Schumer. "We
must find some means of protecting the stuff in case of
storms; those old rain pools would do if we could only
drain them, but we can't without labor. It's always
want of labor that has stopped us. Well, we'll get it
some day."</p>

<p>Though no real business could be done on the fishery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
till more help was obtainable, the temptation to work
was irresistible.</p>

<p>Those first pearls were always in their minds. It
was humanly impossible to rest content with that sample,
and refrain from the attempt to get more, even in
face of the exhausting labor of diving and dredging.</p>

<p>But they worked less ambitiously now, and so carefully
that the day's take of shell did not amount to half
the take on the first day. As a result they were fresh
when they knocked off, instead of being worn out.</p>

<p>They left the oysters to rot, and so it went on day
by day, till at the end of the week they knocked off the
diving one evening and contemplated their handiwork.
Each day's take had been placed separately, and the
first day's was now "ripe," to use Schumer's expression.</p>

<p>"We'll start on it to-morrow," said he, "and go
through it slowly so that there may be no chance of
anything escaping; the dredge wants mending, too&mdash;we'd
better do that to-night after supper. Isbel can
make another pocket for it. I wish we had diving
dresses and an air pump, and when we get the business
properly fixed we may be able to obtain them; but
there's no use in thinking of that now."</p>

<p>They got into the boat, and Floyd sculled her back,
Schumer sitting in the stern and conning them clear of
the floating wreckage near the camping place. It
grieved Schumer's heart to see all that stuff waste and
ungetable. He was one of the men who can make use
of anything almost to further or maintain his set purpose.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE SCHOONER</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> started for the fishing ground next morning
immediately after breakfast, and set to work at
once. They had bad luck for the first hour, and then,
as if popped into their hands by the hand of luck, came
a beauty, a perfect white pearl, twice the size of a marrow-fat
pea, maybe even a little bigger, worth five
thousand dollars if a penny&mdash;so Schumer said.</p>

<p>They sat down to congratulate themselves and feel
their luck. You cannot feel your luck standing. Schumer
lit a pipe and Floyd followed his example. They
put a bit of seaweed on a shell and the pearl on the seaweed,
and with it in front of them began to speculate
and talk. They felt now that time was theirs, and
Schumer knew, though Floyd was still to learn, that the
flower of success blooms only on the youngest shoots,
that the joy of striking it rich lives only in perfection
during the first early days of the stroke, that the fever
of life and the enchantment of triumph both die down
and fade, that the fully grasped is nothing to the half
grasped.</p>

<p>To be given a pearl lagoon by luck and to work it as
a hog works a wood for truffles would be to act like a
hog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>The stuff was all there; this and the success of the
first day's work was ample confirmation of the riches
lying under that green water, and Schumer expatiated
on the matter.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't believe it," said he, "but the value of
a single pearl grows in proportion as you can match it
with others exactly like it. It takes eighty or a hundred
pearls to make a woman's necklace. Eighty or a hundred
pearls like that one would each be worth two or
three times what each pearl is worth alone. Even
twenty pearls exactly alike would be worth much more
than if they were different, for they would form the
basis for a collection. You would never dream of the
work that goes on in the world matching these things.
There are men at it all the time in Paris and London
and Amsterdam. A perfect necklace of pearls once
formed is always held together; it becomes an individual,
so to speak, and is known to the trade by a
name. The women belonging to the royal families of
Europe hold a number of these collections, but there
are lots of private ones, and every great collection is
known and tabulated. So you see it won't pay us to
peddle our stuff out little by little&mdash;we must hold all
the pearls we get and match them."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Floyd, "one thing we have never
settled&mdash;our shares in this business. There's Isbel,
too; she has done her bit."</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"What's the use of money to a Kanaka?" said he.
"We'll give her something, of course, but we need not
take her seriously into our calculations. Our shares&mdash;well,
don't you think it's a bit early to come to that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
All this is a dream in the air at present; it may never
go farther."</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way," said Floyd, "I always think
it's well to start out knowing exactly where you are
going to, and what you are to get. When you sign on
in a ship you know your pay, and you know the latitudes
you have got to work in, and you know the time
you are to be on the job. I think it would be better here
and now to settle up this business, and I think we ought
to go half shares."</p>

<p>"Half shares?" said Schumer meditatively.</p>

<p>"I have been figuring it out in my head," said Floyd.
"What have we each contributed to the business? I
have brought my work and a boat; now, without a boat
we'd have been done completely, because you can't
reach here by the reef, and we couldn't have discovered
the beds without a boat. Then there's my work. You
have brought your knowledge of pearling, and, what
is more, all that trade stuff and provisions from the
wreck, your energy and enterprise and your work.
When I said half shares I did not mean that all the
trade and provisions of the <i>Tonga</i> should not be taken
into consideration. I would suggest that when we settle
up I should pay you for all that out of my share.
Then there is the money of the <i>Tonga</i> and the <i>Cormorant</i>.
While I hold that Coxon's money belongs by
right to his next of kin, I think what I have suffered
through his relative, Harrod, permits me to use that
money to further our speculation, paying it back with
interest to the next of kin when all is through. So I
would be nearly equal to you in ready cash, and the
question resolves itself into my boat and work against
your work and knowledge of pearling."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>"I must point out to you," said Schumer, "that I discovered
the beds."</p>

<p>"That is true, but without the boat where would you
have been? If a ship had come along and you had borrowed
a boat to explore the lagoon, the whole affair
would have been given away. I am not arguing to
make a profit out of the business at your expense, only
to give my full views on the matter."</p>

<p>Schumer sat silent for a minute, and Floyd again
noticed that profile, daring and predominant, hard and
predatory. It was as though the spirit of a hawk were
gazing over the sea through the mask of a man.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Schumer, "that the boat belonged
to Coxon."</p>

<p>"And the <i>Tonga</i>?" said Floyd.</p>

<p>Schumer shifted uneasily; then he laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, let it be so," said he; "half shares, and you
pay for the trade and provisions; it's early to talk of
dividing what we have not got. Still, as you wish it, I
agree."</p>

<p>He spoke without enthusiasm. Then he rose up.
They had been sitting on the weather side of the reef,
with their backs to the lagoon and their faces to the sea;
the wind had almost died away, and now as they turned
they saw, away across the lagoon, a thin column of
black smoke rising from the camping place through the
almost windless air.</p>

<p>"It's the signal!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>"A ship!" cried Schumer.</p>

<p>He sheltered his eyes, and Floyd, doing the same,
saw the figure of Isbel moving about near the fire. She
was putting fresh brushwood on the flames, and even as
they looked the smoke increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Schumer picked up the pearl that was still lying in
the shell and put it in his pocket. He glanced at the
heaps of shell still untouched. There was no time to
cast all that back in the lagoon or hide the evidence of
their work; it was necessary to get back at once, and,
returning to the boat, which was beached on the sand,
they shoved off, Floyd taking the sculls.</p>

<p>When they reached the beach, Isbel was there, and
helped to run the boat up.</p>

<p>"A ship," said she. "Schooner, I think, away over
there."</p>

<p>She pointed across the reef toward the outer sea.</p>

<p>The deck of the <i>Tonga</i> had always given them a
vantage point and a lookout station; even without it
now, just by standing on the reef where the wreck had
been they could see the sail, and Schumer, after a brief
glance, went off to the tent, which they had restablished
by the grove, and fetched a pair of glasses.</p>

<p>Through them she leaped into view, a topsail
schooner, with all sail set, making a long board for the
island.</p>

<p>"She's coming here, sure," said Schumer; "a hundred
and fifty or maybe a hundred and eighty tons I
reckon her to be; but it is deceitful at this distance.
Wonder what she is? Wonder what she's doing down
here? She may have been blown out of her course by
that storm; but she hasn't lost any sticks. Well, we'll
soon see."</p>

<p>They watched the sail as she grew white as a pearl
against the sky. The sea had lost all trace of the late
storm, and there remained only the undying swell of
the Pacific.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's the matter with her," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Floyd, as he took a spell with the glasses; "but she
seems to be handled by lubbers. Either they have not
enough men to work the sails, or the officers are fools."</p>

<p>Schumer took the glasses and watched her, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>One of the coconut trees at the entrance end of the
grove stood apart from its fellows; it had been stripped
of nuts and pretty well stripped of leaves by the storm.
At the suggestion of Schumer, Floyd, with a flag tied
round his neck like a huge muffler, and with a hammer
and some nails in his pocket, swarmed up the tree and
nailed the flag to the wood. The wind was strong
enough to make it flutter, and with a glass aboard the
schooner it would be easily visible.</p>

<p>It evidently remained unseen, for no answer showed.</p>

<p>"She's blind, as well as stupid," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"There's something wrong with her," said Schumer,
"and if she comes blundering into the lagoon she may
hit that reef we noticed the other day on the left of the
entrance. We had better get the boat out and show her
the way in when she gets a bit closer."</p>

<p>The schooner was two miles from the reef when they
began launching the boat. They rowed out through the
break in the reef, and then hoisted the sail.</p>

<p>"She sees us now," said Floyd.</p>

<p>A flag had been run up to the peak; it was the Stars
and Stripes. Then it was run down again, then again
hoisted.</p>

<p>"Crew of lunatics," said Schumer, as the American
flag went down again and was replaced by the Union
Jack. "What are they at now?"</p>

<p>"They seem to be a mixed nationality," said Floyd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
"and rather confused in their mind. Look, she's heaving
to!"</p>

<p>The wind shivered out the canvas and the topsails
flattened.</p>

<p>She was, as Schumer had guessed, a schooner of
some hundred and fifty tons, and well found, to judge
by her general appearance, her canvas, and what they
could judge of her sticks.</p>

<p>As they came alongside they saw that her decks were
crowded with men, all natives; not a white face showed,
and as they boarded her a hubbub rose such as Floyd
had never heard before.</p>

<p>Forty Kanakas, mad with excitement and all trying to
explain themselves, some in broken English and some
in native, produced more impression than understanding.</p>

<p>Schumer took hold of affairs by seizing on a big man
whom he judged with unerring eye to be in some position
of authority. Then he held up his fist and yelled:
"Silence!"</p>

<p>The row ceased in a second, and only Schumer's
voice was heard:</p>

<p>"You talk English?"</p>

<p>"Me talk allee right," replied the big man. "Me
savvee English me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up and answer my questions! What schooner
is this, and where from?"</p>

<p>"She de <i>Sudden Cross</i>."</p>

<p>"The <i>Southern Cross</i>; where from?"</p>

<p>"Sydney long time 'go; lass po't in de Sol'mons.
Capen, off'cers, all gone; fish p'ison."</p>

<p>"Fish poisoning, was it? What was your captain's
name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"Capen Watters."</p>

<p>"Walters, most like," said Schumer. "Well, what
are all these men&mdash;they aren't the crew?"</p>

<p>"Some de crew; some labor picked up down de Sol'mons,
an' islan's away dere."</p>

<p>"And your cargo?"</p>

<p>"Copra, most."</p>

<p>While Schumer was talking, Floyd was looking about
him at the men on deck. There were a dozen Solomon
Islanders, some wearing nothing but G strings, nearly
all with shell rings through their nostrils, and some with
tobacco pipes stuck in their perforated ear lobes.</p>

<p>He thought he had never seen a harder lot of natives
than these. The others were milder looking.</p>

<p>Schumer, meanwhile, went on with his inquiries. The
name of the big man was Mountain Joe; he was bos'n.
The schooner, since the loss of her officers, had been in
a hopeless state, as not a soul on board knew anything
of navigation. There had been four white men&mdash;the
captain, two mates, and a third man, evidently a trader
or labor recruiter&mdash;and the fish that had done the
mischief had been canned salmon; evidently ptomaine
poisoning in its most virulent form had attacked the
only people who had partaken of it.</p>

<p>When Schumer had received all this intelligence, he
ordered the boat to be streamed astern on a line, and
took command of the schooner.</p>

<p>Without with your leave or by your leave, he gave
his orders no less to Floyd than to Mountain Joe.</p>

<p>The Solomon Islanders and the other natives who
had no part in the working of the vessel fell apart from
the crew, who sprang to the braces at the order of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
new skipper, the sails took the wind, and the <i>Southern
Cross</i> began to forge ahead.</p>

<p>The wind was favorable for the lagoon opening, and
as they neared it Schumer ordered Floyd forward to
con the ship while he himself took the wheel.</p>

<p>As he steered, he gave his orders to Mountain Joe
to get ready with the anchor. The <i>Southern Cross</i> responded
to her helm as a sensitive horse to the bit, and
like a great white cloud she glided over the swell at the
reef opening, and like a great white swan she floated
into the lagoon.</p>

<p>Then the wind shook out the sails, and the rumble-tumble
of the anchor chain sounded over the water as
she came to in five fathoms, and within a pistol shot of
the camping place.</p>

<p>Isbel was standing on the beach sheltering her eyes
with her hand, and some of the Kanaka crew, recognizing
her as a native, waved and shouted to her. She
waved her hand in reply.</p>

<p>The schooner now swinging safely at her anchor,
Schumer continued to give orders till all of the remaining
sail was stowed.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Floyd.</p>

<p>"Now, we have her safe and sound," said he, "I
propose we go down and have a look at the manifest,
and so forth."</p>

<p>"You aren't going to land any of these people yet?"
asked Floyd, following him down the companionway to
the saloon.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Schumer; "and when I do land them
it won't be at our camping ground. Hello, you nigger!"
this to Mountain Joe, who had followed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
down; "what you doing here? Get on deck or I'll boot
you up the ladder&mdash;cheek!"</p>

<p>Mountain Joe vanished.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Floyd, as he shut the door of the
saloon, "do you believe that yarn of the fish poisoning?"</p>

<p>"I don't," said Schumer; "I believe the white men
were done up. They were a hard lot, most likely, and
they met their match. There was fighting on deck, for
there was a bullet mark on the wheel, one of the spokes
was injured; not only that, I could tell from the manner
of those fellows that the big Kanaka was lying. Ah,
what's this?"</p>

<p>He went to one of the panels of the saloon by the
door. It was split by a bullet.</p>

<p>"Look at that!" said he.</p>

<p>"It's clear enough," replied Floyd, "there has been
fighting down here, too. Devils!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Schumer, "we haven't heard their
side of the story yet. Come on, let us search and see
what we can find."</p>

<p>They entered the biggest cabin opening off the saloon.
It was evidently the captain's. Here things
were in order, the bunk undisturbed, and a suit of
pajamas neatly folded on the quilt.</p>

<p>"Bunk hasn't even been lain on," said Schumer, "and
where would a sick man lie but on his bunk or in it?
These Kanakas are fools&mdash;soft heads; they can't put
two and two together, or imagine other people doing it.
Now, let's look for the ship's papers."</p>

<p>They hunted, but though they discovered the box
which evidently had contained the papers, sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
papers or money there was none. Neither was there
sign of the log.</p>

<p>"They have done away with them," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Looks so," replied Schumer. "Unless the old man
swallowed them before he died. Ah, here's a coat of
his!"</p>

<p>A coat hanging from a peg by the bunk attracted his
attention.</p>

<p>He examined the pockets, and discovered a number
of letters, an American dollar, a tobacco pouch, and a
pipe. He returned the pipe and the pouch, and placed
the letters in his pocket.</p>

<p>"We'll examine them later on," said he; "they may
give us some news. Now let's look at this chest and
see what it holds."</p>

<p>He raised the lid of a sea chest standing opposite
the bunk, and began to explore the contents. It contained
mostly clothes, boots, some island curios, and
down in one corner another packet of letters, which
Schumer took possession of.</p>

<p>On the inside of the lid was nailed the portrait of a
stout woman&mdash;the unfortunate man's wife, perhaps.</p>

<p>To Floyd there was something mournful in the sight
of these few possessions&mdash;all that was left on earth of
a man living a few weeks ago, or maybe a few days ago,
and now vanished utterly; done to death, most probably,
by the savages on deck. But Schumer did not
seem at all disturbed by any reflections on the matter.
With speed but no hurry he went through the business,
closed the lid, and rose up.</p>

<p>"Let's get on deck," said he; "we can overhaul the
other cabins later on. I have seen what I wanted to
see, and there's no use in leaving those fellows on deck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
too long without attention. I'll have another talk with
the big Kanaka, and then we'll go ashore and have a
council of war."</p>

<p>"Shall we let any of these chaps land?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>"Not yet; and when we do we'll land them at the reef
by the fishing ground. Looks like Providence, doesn't
it? We wanted labor, and it seems we've got it."</p>

<p>"They seem a tough crowd," said Floyd, as he followed
his companion up the saloon stairs.</p>

<p>"They are," said Schumer grimly; "but they'll be
softer when I have done with them."</p>

<p>On deck, the crew and the Solomon Islanders were
scattered about, mostly smoking. Some were seated on
the deck; others, leaning over the bulwark rails, were
staring at the shore. There was no sign of disorder
or danger; the unfortunates were too glad to be in a
place of safety, after their experience of driving about
the Pacific without a navigator.</p>

<p>The open sea is a terrific place to the Pacific islander
when he does not know in what part of it he is, and
when he is left to his own resources. Schumer's prompt
action in bringing them into the lagoon, the way he
handled the ship, and the manner in which he had given
his orders at once raised him to the position of the man
in authority.</p>

<p>He ordered the boat, which was still streaming
astern, with the rope held taut by the outgoing tide, to
be hauled alongside, then he told Mountain Joe to get
in, and, following him with Floyd, they pushed off for
the shore.</p>

<p>When they landed, Schumer called to Isbel, who
came out of the bushes. He told her to look after the
big Kanaka and give him some refreshment, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
taking Floyd by the arm, he led him over to the windward
side of the reef, and at a point protected by trees
from the lagoon they sat down.</p>

<p>Said Schumer:</p>

<p>"When you are starting out on any business everything
depends on whether you have got a plan to go on
<i>at the start</i>. A lot of darned fools blunder along in the
businesses they take up without even a plan. If they
have a plan, it's one that turns up by accident.</p>

<p>"Now, here's our position: Luck has sent us a
schooner and a certain quantity of labor. Good management
and foresight has given us a lot of trade, provisions,
and arms; all that will be useless if we don't
act at once on a plan.</p>

<p>"If we let those fellows land here, and if they discover
the position of the cache, it's quite on the cards
they might try to rush us. They mustn't touch the
ground here; they must be segregated over there at the
fishing ground. We have a splendid strategical position,
with a section of the reef impassable, or next to
impassable, for if they tried to come along it they'd
have to go so slow we could pick them off with our
Winchesters.</p>

<p>"But that's all meeting trouble halfway. Our policy
is to keep them happy after putting the fear of God
into them.</p>

<p>"I shall land them to-night over there, but first of
all I am going to show them exactly how things stand,
and what they may expect if they make trouble.</p>

<p>"Now come back, and we will have a talk with Mr.
Mountain Joe."</p>

<p>They came back to the tent, where the dusky bos'n
was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Isbel, who had been giving him refreshments, was
standing by. When she saw Floyd and Schumer approaching,
she went off toward the tent, and the three
men found themselves alone.</p>

<p>Out in the lagoon lay the schooner, the crowd on her
deck leaning on the bulwark rails, and evidently speculating
on what might be going on ashore.</p>

<p>Joe, who had been seated, rose up, and Schumer, taking
his seat on the sand beside Floyd, ordered the Kanaka
to stand before him.</p>

<p>Schumer, taking a tobacco pouch from his pocket
and a book of cigarette papers, proceeded to roll a
cigarette. As he ran the tip of his tongue along the
gummed edge of the paper he looked up at Joe.</p>

<p>"What made you tell that lie," said he, "about the
fish poisoning?"</p>

<p>Joe started as though some one had made an attempt
to strike him.</p>

<p>"What fish p'isonin', sah?"</p>

<p>"Now, don't you try any games with me," said Schumer,
who had lighted his cigarette. "I know all about
the affair, and I am going to see justice done. Your
captain was killed, the mates were killed, and the other
white man was done away with and hove overboard. I
take it he was not a trader, but a labor recruiter. Don't
open your mouth to lie, or I'll put a bullet in it!"</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a revolver,
which he placed on his thigh.</p>

<p>"You just hear me through, for I am going to tell
you things. To begin with, I doubt if you had any
hand in the killing. I judge you by your face. Had
you any hand in it? You may speak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>The man's lips were dry; his tongue could scarcely
form the words:</p>

<p>"No, sah, it was not me."</p>

<p>"It was some of those Solomon Islanders?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sah."</p>

<p>"Which was the one that did it? There's always one
that takes the lead."</p>

<p>Joe was silent.</p>

<p>"Which was the one that did it?" asked Schumer
again, without the least change in his voice, but with
his hand now on the butt of the revolver.</p>

<p>"De big one, sah, wid de woolly head an' eyes so."</p>

<p>He tried to squint.</p>

<p>"Ah, that chap! I noticed him, and I took his
measure."</p>

<p>Then, little by little, he drew out the whole story.
It had been a bad voyage for the <i>Southern Cross</i>. They
had been recruiting down in the Solomon Islands, and
the recruiter, Markham by name, had been nearly
cut off.</p>

<p>He had adopted the usual methods, landing on the
beach with a box of trade goods and without any
weapons, while a covering boat hung offshore to protect
him in case of attack.</p>

<p>The natives had seemed friendly, but all at once
they had drawn off, scattering toward the bush, from
where next moment had come a flight of their deadly
spears, one of which had pierced Markham's arm.
With the spear still in his arm, he had managed to get
off, and under protection of the fire from the covering
boat had succeeded in reaching the schooner. The
spear had been cut out, or, rather, cut off at the barb
and drawn out, but the wound had bothered him a lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>The thirty natives he had managed to secure before
the business suffered a good bit at his hand in return
for it. The captain and the mates had not been behindhand;
some of the crew had run away, and the
schooner was shorthanded; that did not add to their
good temper. They tried to make the Solomon Islanders
help in the working of the vessel, but these gentry
had not engaged themselves for ship work, but plantation
work, and they said so. The captain had booted
some of them and threatened to shoot others, and generally
the schooner seemed to have been a hard ship.
There seemed the distinct evidence of a trail of drink
over the whole business, and the upshot was death for
the afterguard.</p>

<p>Death dealt with belaying pins and an ax wielded by
the woolly-headed individual with the squint.</p>

<p>Two natives had been shot dead on the spot, one
had been wounded, and had died of his wounds. Then
the decks had been swabbed, and the precious crew,
without a navigating officer or the faintest notion of
their exact position, had made sail, or, rather, made
a fair wind that was blowing, trusting to chance to take
them somewhere.</p>

<p>They had touched the skirt of the big storm, but they
managed to weather it, and, seeing the island in sight,
had made for it.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "I believe you have been telling
me the truth. I am here to do justice, and justice
shall be done."</p>

<p>He rose up, and drawing Floyd aside, walked a few
paces with him along the beach.</p>

<p>"That fellow with the squint was evidently the leader
in this business," said he. "I am not thinking so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of the trouble on board the schooner, for it's pretty evident
that the old man and the mates and the recruiter
deserved their gruel. What I am thinking of is the
time before us. I am going to make these chaps work
the fishery, and I don't want a potential murder leader
among them. That wouldn't do at all. Besides, they
must be shown at once their position in the scheme
of things, and that position is laborers working for
decent pay, but under a strong hand. Besides, all these
fellows have murder on their conscience&mdash;or the thing,
whatever it is, that serves for their conscience. That
will always make them nervous and distrustful of white
men. I can't clear their consciences, but I can clear
their minds of the fear of consequences, and I am going
to do it now.</p>

<p>"You have your revolver in your pocket; get your
rifle, also, and come with me. We may have to fight;
there's no knowing."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't mind if we have," said Floyd; "rotten
murderers!"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are all right! They are only savages, doing
according to their lights. They only require firmness
to do according to the lights of civilization."</p>

<p>He went to the tent with Floyd, and they got their
rifles and some extra ammunition. Then, with the help
of Joe, they pushed the boat off.</p>

<p>The fellows on board watched the coming of the
boat, evidently suspecting nothing, though they must
have seen the rifles.</p>

<p>Schumer was the first to come on board, followed by
Floyd.</p>

<p>They walked aft, and Joe, when he had finished securing
the boat, followed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Schumer sent him below for two deck chairs which
he had seen in the saloon; they were placed close to
the wheel, and the white men, taking their seats, and
with the rifles across their knees, Schumer threw his old
panama hat on the deck about fifteen paces away from
where he was sitting, and ordered all hands aft for a
palaver.</p>

<p>No man was to take a step beyond the hat.</p>

<p>They came up, some of them still smoking, some
chewing, and all evidently wondering what was up, and
what the bearded white man with the fixed, determined
face had to say to them.</p>

<p>Though he could speak in the dialect of the Solomons,
he made Joe his interpreter.</p>

<p>He asked the labor hands first what wages the recruiter
had promised them for plantation work.</p>

<p>They were very explicit on this point. They were
each to receive in trade goods, tobacco, knives, and so
forth what would be the equivalent of about seven
pounds a year. They were, of course, to be fed and
looked after.</p>

<p>Schumer, taking a pencil and a piece of paper from
his pocket, made calculations. Then he addressed them
through Joe. He said that he and Floyd were owners
of this island, which was a very pleasant place, as they
could see for themselves, with plenty of food, both
grown here and brought to them regularly by a ship,
which they also owned.</p>

<p>To allow this to sink into their intelligence, he proceeded
to roll a cigarette; when he had lit it, he went
on.</p>

<p>He would offer them work here, and a happy life,
and a return home at the end of a year, if they desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
to return. The work was very easy, and play, compared
to plantation work; it was simply diving for shellfish.
They could all dive?</p>

<p>A flashing of white teeth answered this question in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>He would pay them exactly the same wages as that
offered for plantation work; each man would have to
collect so much shell&mdash;the amount would be fixed later&mdash;and
for all shell collected over and above the stipulated amount,
a bonus would be paid in tobacco or whatever they liked.</p>

<p>The bonus business had to be explained to them, and
the idea took hold upon their imaginations at once.</p>

<p>They agreed to everything. The island pleased
them; there was evidence of what Schumer had stated
all round&mdash;plenty of trees, fruit, and in the lagoon
fish. It seemed to them that they had dropped on
their feet at last. They broke up into little groups
and chattered over the business while Schumer sat
watching them with a brooding eye.</p>

<p>Any other man, one might fancy, would have been
more than satisfied by the success which had apparently
met his offer. In reality, he had only begun what he
had set out to do.</p>

<p>When they had talked together long enough, he
gave orders to Joe, and they were lined up again.
Asked if they agreed to the terms offered to them,
they replied, "Yes."</p>

<p>Then Schumer, throwing the end of his cigarette
away, crossing his knees, and nursing the rifle lying
across his lap, began speaking to them in their own
dialect without the aid of Joe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>He talked to the Solomon Islanders, but the others
quite understood his words.</p>

<p>He pointed out that from what he had seen below
stairs, he knew for a fact that the captain of the <i>Southern
Cross</i> and the other white men had not died from
fish poisoning, but from blows. He told them that an
English man-of-war was cruising in the neighborhood
of the island, and that if she caught them they would
undoubtedly be hanged to a man; he gave them a pantomime
with his hand at his throat to help their imaginations,
and, seeing the effect produced, at once started
on a new line.</p>

<p>They had nothing to fear if they trusted in him and
in the white man beside him, but justice must be done.
It was impossible for white men to allow other white
men to be murdered or killed without bringing the murderers
to book.</p>

<p>He did not believe that they were all implicated, but
he did believe that there was one among their number
who had led them to this act.</p>

<p>Dead silence among the audience, whose faces laughing
a moment ago, were now a picture representing all
the emotions that range between furtiveness and fright.</p>

<p>No one spoke.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Schumer, still speaking in the
native, "if you will not speak it will be the worse for
you. I am not your enemy. I am your friend, and
am able to protect you all from the consequences of
what has been done; but I will not do so unless I can
punish the man who was chief in this business. You
will not show him to me; well, then, I will find him for
myself, for I have been born with the means of know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>ing
men, and I can see their thoughts, just as you can
see the fish that swim in the lagoon."</p>

<p>He rose from his seat and walked toward where
they were standing. The line bent back for a moment,
as though they were going to break away and run, then
they stood their ground; every eye was fixed on him
as he went from one to the other, lifting this one's
chin with his finger, resting his hand on that one's head.</p>

<p>Floyd, still seated, had his rifle ready in case of accidents,
but it was not needed. The diplomacy of Schumer
had made the crowd afraid, not of him, but of the
consequences of their act, and to cap that, they were
held by the fascination of this business and the curiosity
to see what was about to happen.</p>

<p>When Schumer reached the squint-eyed individual
he placed his hand on his head. Then he snatched it
away, as though something had stung him, and looked
at the palm.</p>

<p>"You are the man," said he. "Look!"</p>

<p>He held up his palm for a second; there was nothing
in it, but every man in that crowd saw something,
according to his imagination.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE PUNISHMENT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Floyd's</span> finger went to the trigger of the rifle
across his knees. He expected a sudden attack
by the criminal on his accuser, but the man did nothing.</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the crowd, the sort of
murmur that would have followed the exhibition of a
conjuring trick, while Schumer, taking his man by the
arm, led him apart from the rest and made him stand
with his back to the port bulwarks.</p>

<p>"Is what I say true?" he asked, turning to Joe.</p>

<p>He had calculated on everything, and he knew that
Joe the informer would never, never reveal to the others
that his&mdash;Schumer's&mdash;magic gift of seeing the truth
through men's skulls was a trick based on information.</p>

<p>For a moment Joe, between the devil and the deep
sea, gazed wildly round him, then he bent his head in
assent.</p>

<p>"So," said Schumer, then he turned to Floyd. "You
are one of the judges of this man. I am the other, but
I am president of this court, and I have the casting
vote&mdash;pronounce your sentence."</p>

<p>"He deserves death," said Floyd; "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"I would prefer to isolate him on some part of the
island and hand him over to the first ship."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Schumer turned to Joe, and, pointing to a whaleboat
hanging at the davits, ordered it to be lowered.</p>

<p>When it was afloat he gave orders for the whole of
the labor men to get into it, telling them that all was
clear now that the chief offender was to be punished,
and that no more would be said on the matter, that
their work would be paid for on the terms he had
named, and that their future lot would be happiness,
good pay, good food, and plenty of it.</p>

<p>They crowded down into the boat. There were
thirty of them, and they filled it nearly. Then, leaving
Floyd on board with Joe and the Kanaka crew and the
criminal, he got into the boat and took his place at the
tiller.</p>

<p>The Solomanders rowed villainously, but they made
the whaleboat move, and Floyd, with one eye on the
murderer, who had now taken his seat on the deck,
watched Schumer steering them for the fishing ground
and landing them on the beach.</p>

<p>He landed them, and seemed to be explaining things.
Floyd caught glimpses of him waving his arm about
almost as though he were pointing out the view.</p>

<p>Then with two of them for oarsmen he came back.</p>

<p>Floyd, as Schumer came on deck, felt sick at heart.
He hated the crime, and he hated the sight of the
criminal, but he hated even more the idea of death,
and he knew that the man now crouched on the deck
was surely going to die.</p>

<p>Schumer, as he came on deck, seemed Fate itself&mdash;calm,
cold, passionless Fate. The judge, the hangman,
and the rope all in one.</p>

<p>The Kanakas seemed to guess it; the very brightness
of the day seemed grown paler. Floyd walked to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
bulwark rail and looked over at the boat where the
two rowers were seated looking up at the vessel. His
lips were dry. He could do nothing; whatever was
going to happen was deserved, but it was horrible.</p>

<p>He heard Schumer giving his orders for signal halyard
line and a block. The <i>Southern Cross</i> carried a
brass cannonade for saluting purposes, and now he
heard Schumer giving orders for it to be loaded.</p>

<p>I have said that the <i>Southern Cross</i> was a topsail
schooner, and at this moment the crowd of laborers
away out at the fishing ground had their attention
drawn by the movement going on upon the rigging of
the foremast; men were swarming up, and a fellow
was out on the yard&mdash;he looked at that distance like
a fly against the blue. He came down, as did the
others, and he had scarcely reached the deck when a
white jet of smoke shot like a plume from the bow of
the <i>Southern Cross</i>, and the noise of a gun came on
the wind.</p>

<p>Something black and struggling, and just like a
spider running up a thread, went from the deck of the
<i>Southern Cross</i> to the yardarm, touched it, and then
sank some half dozen feet, and swung dangling against
the sky. It was the murderer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE POWER OF SCHUMER</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">During</span> it all Floyd had kept his eyes turned
away. When the men had come running aft
with the halyard line they had knocked against him,
making him shift his position, and now, with the dead
man swinging aloft, he walked over to the weather
side, seemingly an impassive figure, with his rifle under
his arm keeping guard.</p>

<p>As he stood looking over the water to the camping
place he saw Isbel. She had come out on the sands and
she was standing with her hand shading her eyes. She
must have been a witness of the whole tragedy, and
she stood, motionless as a figure carved from stone&mdash;for
a moment. Then she turned, and just as though
something were in pursuit of her, she ran, making for
the grove, into which she disappeared.</p>

<p>Floyd swore under his breath. That the girl should
have been allowed to see such a thing struck him as a
monstrous fact. Gentle, kindly, and willing she had
been, almost unknown to himself, the one bright spot
in his life on the island. The one human thing to keep
life warm. Schumer had been a companion who had
never grown into anything more than an acquaintance;
Isbel, though he had talked to her as little as he would
have talked to a dog, had been a friend. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
understand her at all; she had lived her own life,
thought her own thoughts, and said little; a child living
in a child's world of which he knew nothing, but she
had somehow kept his heart warm, and now she had
been allowed to see <i>this</i>, the doing to death of one of
her own people in the broad light of day.</p>

<p>What could she know of the justice of the case? He
turned to Schumer, who had come toward him now
that everything was finished, and, taking him by the
arm, led him to the weather rail; they leaned over the
rail as they talked.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Floyd, "that child has seen
the whole of this business?"</p>

<p>"What child?"</p>

<p>"Isbel."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that?"</p>

<p>"What of that? She stood there watching it all,
and then she ran off as if some one were going to kill
her. It was brutal to let her see it; goodness knows
she has stuck to us and done everything for us a mortal
could do, and now we repay her by letting her see us
hanging one of her own people."</p>

<p>Schumer seemed disturbed and irritated by this
news.</p>

<p>"One cannot think of everything," said he; "you
speak as though you were accusing me. Am I to do all
the thinking? Well, she has seen what she has seen,
and it cannot be helped, though I would not have had
it for a good deal. That girl may be very useful to us
yet, and we do not want to make an enemy of her. She
will brood over this and say nothing, and then maybe
let us have it in the back some time. Well, we cannot
help it; we must remedy it somehow. There is no use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in talking about it with the business we have to do
before us. First we must bring stores and some canvas
to make tents for those labor men. Come, we will
get the stuff together now and take it to them in the
whaleboat; we will take two of the crew with us to
help to row."</p>

<p>They rousted out some spare canvas from the sail
room of the schooner, and had it sent into the whaleboat,
which was still alongside, with the two Solomon
Islanders who had rowed her out sitting on the thwarts
and staring up at the form dangling overhead.</p>

<p>It seemed to fill them with curiosity, nothing more;
yet Floyd noticed that when Schumer spoke to them
they jumped to attention as though they had been
addressed by some powerful chief. The crew also ran
about at his least sign, hauled with all their energy, and
hung on his words.</p>

<p>Schumer did not go to the cache for provisions; he
opened the schooner's lazaret. She was well supplied.
Though the mutineers had killed their officers they had
not sacked the provision room and broached the liquor
as they would have done had they been Europeans.</p>

<p>"They were helpless, you see, like a duck with a
broken wing," said Schumer. "Didn't know where
they were; didn't know who would catch them. Kanakas
will drink, but they don't fly to drink like our
chaps; it's not grained in them."</p>

<p>They made a selection of tins and had them brought
on deck and hoisted into the boat. Schumer added
some sticks of tobacco, and they pushed off and rowed
for the fishing ground.</p>

<p>The laborers waiting on the beach helped them to
land. They were a very subdued lot indeed; the sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of the hanging seemed to have put them under a spell
as far as the white men were concerned, and they
worked at the unlading of the stores without a word,
yet with all their energy.</p>

<p>When the stuff was landed, Schumer began to talk
to them. He asked them to choose a foreman, and,
having consulted together for a few minutes, they
picked out one of their number&mdash;a man with a huge
shell ring through his nostrils, split ear lobes, and scar
marks on his chest and all down his left arm.</p>

<p>Sru was the name of this individual, and Schumer,
as he watched him step out from the ranks, regretted
the choice. He suspected that they had chosen him,
not because he was a favorite, but because he was
feared. This is always bad, because in dealing with
a mass of natives&mdash;and the same holds good for Europeans&mdash;authority
has most to fear from the individual.
It is the one man who makes the bother, and the man
who is feared, if he is placed in a position of supremacy,
is more likely to make trouble than the man who
is loved.</p>

<p>However, they had chosen a foreman at Schumer's
request, and it was not for him to interfere with their
choice. He set to and gave them directions as to how
they were to make their camp, placed the provisions
and tobacco under charge of the foreman, ordered
them to be ready for work next morning at sunup, and
then returned to the schooner, leaving the two laborers
behind with the others.</p>

<p>On board he gave an order for the body to be lowered
and cast in the lagoon, where the sharks were
patiently waiting for their prey; then with Floyd he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
returned to the camping ground, rowing themselves
across in the ship's dinghy.</p>

<p>They had left on board the whole native crew with
Joe to supervise them.</p>

<p>They beached the dinghy by the quarter boat, and
walked up to the tent. Isbel was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>Schumer looked round for her, called, received no
answer, and then, with his own hands, prepared to
light the fire and make the supper.</p>

<p>The sun was now low down over the western roof,
and the lagoon was filling with gold; the schooner,
freed from the horror dangling at her yardarm, lay
with her anchor chain taut, and the golden ripples of
the incoming tide racing past her sides. She made a
beautiful picture with the sunset light upon her masts
and spars, the gulls flying and flitting about her, crying
as they wheeled.</p>

<p>It was the time of the full moon, and she rose with
the dark. Schumer had gone to the tent, where he had
placed the letters and papers taken from the captain's
coat on board the <i>Southern Cross</i>. He returned with
them in his hand, and, taking his seat by the embers
of the fire, he began to examine them.</p>

<p>He did not require a lamp; one could have read the
smallest print by the moonlight now flooding the world.</p>

<p>It was a poor enough find. There were half a dozen
letters in a woman's handwriting, mostly referring to
remittances received or expected. The addresses at
the head of them told nothing. "One hundred and two
North Street" was the invariable heading, and for date
Monday or Tuesday, without hint of the month in
which they were written. "My dear Joe," they began,
and the ending was always the same, "Your loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Mary." There were no envelopes to give a clew to
the town they came from or the country.</p>

<p>"His loving Mary seemed to have a keen eye for
the boodle," said Schumer. "Ah&mdash;what's this?" He
had opened a letter with the printed heading: "Hakluyt
&amp; Son, Market Street, Sydney." The letter ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Captain Walters</span>:   Owing to Captain Dennison's
illness we are prepared to offer you the <i>Southern Cross</i>, which
is now lying in harbor. If you will call upon us to-morrow
at ten-thirty sharp we will be happy to talk over the matter
with you and make all arrangements.</p>

<p class="right">J. B. for <span class="smcap">Hakluyt &amp; Son.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"That was written four months ago," said Schumer,
looking at the date on the envelope. "They are the
owners, and I believe I know Hakluyt &amp; Son; pair of
rogues, as all shipowners are, but they are rich, if they
are the people I take them for; anyhow it's a good find.
We know the owners. You see, a schooner is not a
thing you can pick up like a purse and put in your
pocket. Unless you run her into a port where there
is no law and sell her for the price of old truck what
are you to do with her? Change her name? Well,
what about your papers and your log, and how are
you going to muzzle your crew, even if they are Kanakas?
You have boards of trade and port officers
everywhere. It's one of the troubles of civilization,
but it has to be faced. Now, on the other hand, knowing
the owners, we have the law not against us but on
our side. The schooner is practically derelict; if we
bring her into port we can claim compensation. I see
a lot of clear sky ahead in this business if it is properly
worked, and we must remember this: the fish-poisoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
business holds good; there's no use in having government
inquiries, though I don't even dread those; we
tried our man fairly and we hanged him as an example
to the others who seemed mutinous."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Floyd. "I want to say something
about that business. I don't deny that fellow got what
he deserved, but there were others in the business, and
there is no doubt at all that they had a lot of provocation.
But you hanged that man less for what he had
done than for what he might do in the future."</p>

<p>"Exactly; and to show the others what they might
expect, and to show them that they have got masters
over them."</p>

<p>"You hanged him as a matter of policy."</p>

<p>"Just so. As a matter of policy first, and as a matter
of punishment second."</p>

<p>"Well, that's where I'm against you."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Killing for policy's sake. I may be wrong, but it's
against my nature to hang a chap so as to strike terror
into others. However, he is hanged and done with,
and there's no use saying any more on the matter."</p>

<p>"Not a bit," said Schumer, going on with the examination
of the papers. There was nothing else of importance;
some receipted bills, some old letters from
chums dated four years back, an envelope with a theater
program in it, and another envelope with a faded
photograph of a woman in a low-necked dress, evidently
the photograph of some actress that had struck
Captain Walters' fancy.</p>

<p>"It's funny what you find among a man's belongings,"
said Schumer. "I've come across a Bible and a
pious letter from his mother in the leavings of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
the biggest blackguards in the world, and I met a man
who told me he had gone through the gear of a parson
who was laid out on a smallpox ship and found books
and pictures that weren't holy. This Walters had an
eye for a pretty girl, and sent his wife remittances
pretty often; that's all his remains say of him. I
reckon he was a poor sort, sentimental, with a taste
for the bottle and with no hold on his crew."</p>

<p>They put the papers away, and Schumer retired to
bed, while Floyd, relighting his pipe, strolled over to
the ocean side of the reef. At night, and especially
when the moon was full, this was a place of terrific
loneliness. One heard the voice of the wastes of the
sea. He sat down on a lump of coral and watched
the rollers coming in and the bursting of the foam
under the moonlight.</p>

<p>The events of the day had depressed him, yet nothing
could have shown better results, as regards their
plans, than the day's work just finished. They wanted
labor for the fishery, and labor had appeared on the
island as though summoned by a genie. They wanted
a ship that would make no trouble, and here was a
schooner floating in the lagoon, a vessel well found and
seaworthy and without eyes or ears to spy on their
doings.</p>

<p>Fortune had turned her face toward them and held
out her hand, and had Floyd been listening to the story
of himself and Schumer told as a yarn his commentary
would have been "Lucky beggars!"</p>

<p>The reality was different, and it disclosed the brutality
which attends success, especially the successful
attempt to lift treasure that is in Nature's keeping.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more fascinating than the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
raiding one of Nature's great banks where she stores
her pearls, her diamonds, or her gold, nothing more
trying to all the endurance and good in man than the
prosecution of that great burglary.</p>

<p>The hanging business had hit Floyd a hard blow;
more than that, the thought of Schumer was now beginning
to threaten his peace like a phantom.</p>

<p>The running away of Isbel at the sight of the hanging
had suddenly cast a new light upon Schumer and
incidentally upon himself.</p>

<p>It was as though Innocence had spoken, condemning
them both. And yet the man had deserved his fate.
Floyd told himself this again and again; it was the
knowledge of this that had prevented him from interfering.
He told himself that, even as a matter of
policy and to protect their own lives against another
outbreak headed by the same leader, the action was
justified.</p>

<p>And yet the phantom remained to disturb his
thoughts. Schumer, the man who had bound himself
up so closely in his life, the man whom he did not understand
in the least, the man whose personality was
so powerful, whose wishes always made themselves
good, and whose word was practically law on that
island.</p>

<p>Schumer was always right; that was part of the
origin of his power; he had the genius to foresee everything
that was coming and the head to prepare for
eventualities. His suggestions were commands based
on reason; his orders were worded so as to seem suggestions;
his personality suffused everything, dominated
all things, and made Floyd feel at times as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
though he were an automaton worked by strings instead
of a living man moved by will.</p>

<p>Yet never had Schumer stirred resentment in him.</p>

<p>That is the most magical power in a great and dominating
personality. It does not irritate; it lulls. Your
little strong man gets his will&mdash;if he gets it&mdash;by setting
everybody by the ears. Your big strong man works
without friction; his men become part of him, his
motives part of them; when they are free to think they
may vaguely wonder at their own subservience and
even resent it in a way, yet they come under again to
the will that bends them as surely as the wheat stalks
come under to the wind when it blows.</p>

<p>Floyd, having smoked for a while, tapped the ashes
out of his pipe and rose up. As he was returning to
the tent he caught the glimmer of something white
among the outer trees of the grove and came toward it.
It passed among the trees, and he followed it, pushing
branches of the hibiscus aside and trampling down the
fern that grew here in profusion.</p>

<p>He was following Isbel, and there, in a little glade
amid the ferns, with her back to an artus tree, crouched
in the moonlight, he brought her to bay.</p>

<p>There was something feline in her attitude, as
though she were about to spring, and her eyes were
fixed on him steadfastly as though watching for his
next move.</p>

<p>"Isbel," he said, speaking loud enough for her to
hear, yet not loud enough to attract the possible attention
of Schumer in the tent near by, "what is the matter
with you? Come, I am not going to hurt you. Don't
you know me?"</p>

<p>He held out his hand, with the finger-tips pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
together, as one holds out one's hand to an animal;
then he took a step toward her.</p>

<p>She turned and whisked away round the tree, and
he heard her movements among the bushes as she
vanished from sight.</p>

<p>He came out of the grove and went back to the tent.</p>

<div class="gap-25"></div>

<p>Next morning when he came out of the tent the first
thing that struck his eye was Isbel. She had returned,
and was setting the sticks for the fire as though nothing
had occurred. But when her business was done
she vanished again, reappearing only in time to help
in the preparation of the evening meal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE HOUSE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be impossible to bring home to your mind,
unless you had experienced it, the vast change
which the presence of the <i>Southern Cross</i> made in the
picture of the lagoon. Not on the retinal picture, but
on the mental.</p>

<p>Her presence altered everything. The place became
a harbor. Those spars fretting the sky, that hull making
green water beneath its copper brought civilization
up hand over fist from a thousand leagues down under.</p>

<p>Loneliness had vanished, the crying of the gulls lost
its melancholy, and the sound of the surf on the reef,
when one noticed it, no longer spoke of desolation.</p>

<p>And, just as the schooner altered the lagoon, so
did the presence of her crew and the labor men alter
the life on the island.</p>

<p>In a moment life had become all hurry and work.</p>

<p>Isbel reappeared regularly to help in the preparation
of their food; she would be on hand when wanted for
any light job, but she never sat by them now when
they talked; she avoided saying a word unless absolutely
obliged to, and when she spoke she no longer
looked Floyd in the eyes.</p>

<p>"She is frightened to death of us and she loathes
us," he thought. "Me just as much as him. I don't
wonder, either."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>Schumer said nothing on the matter; perhaps he was
too busy to notice the change in the girl. He certainly
had his work cut out for him. On the first day he had
to deal with the labor men, showing them their job.
They knew nothing of pearls or the shell business, but
they were like otters in the water, and they picked up
the small technicalities of the labor at once.</p>

<p>Sru especially seemed to take to the work as though
born to it, and Schumer left them under his foremanship
and returned to the schooner, where he had work
for the crew.</p>

<p>He wanted a house. He had already picked out the
site for it in a little clearing of the grove well protected
by the trees from possible storms. The wood was
ready to his hand in the wreckage of the <i>Tonga</i>, which
the lagoon currents had driven into the shoal water of
the southern beach right opposite to the camping place.</p>

<p>Of course he could have cut down trees for his building
material, but every tree in the grove by the camping
place was a valuable asset as a shelter against the
weather. To have used any of the timber from the
other groves of the island would have meant not only
the labor of felling and trimming trees, but of floating
them off and towing across the water.</p>

<p>He made Mountain Joe foreman of the new industry,
explaining to him carefully and minutely the whole
business. All planking had to be collected, made into
small rafts, and towed across the lagoon. The whaleboat
was used for the purpose, and Schumer accompanied
it himself on the first trip to show exactly what
he wanted.</p>

<p>It took two days' hard work before sufficient planking
had been got together, and then began the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
of securing and towing across the heavy timbers to
be used for posts and beams. The whole of this business
from the start of the time when the wood was
lying on the sand near the tent took over a week, during
which time the fishery work was progressing,
though in a leisurely manner.</p>

<p>"There we have thirty chaps at work," said Schumer
on the night when the last of the timber was
salved, "and you'd have imagined that they would have
done fifteen times as much work as you and I per day.
They haven't done more than three times as much.
They play about in the water; they are a bone-lazy lot&mdash;well,
it doesn't matter. If we had half a dozen dependable
overseers to superintend the business when
it comes to searching for the pearls it would be different,
but there is only you and me. So it's no earthly
use getting huge quantities of shell of which we can't
oversee the working properly. Funny thing it is, but
a business has to slow down unless it is perfect in all
parts. Here we have the getters of the raw stuff, and
I could speed them up four times their present rate and
we'd skin the lagoon four times as quick if I had even
three more men like you and me to supervise the getting
of the real stuff&mdash;which is pearls. Yet if I had
those three men they would want a partnership and so
we'd lose in profits. It's as broad as it's long."</p>

<p>They were sitting by the fire, and Schumer as he
talked was putting finishing touches to a drawing he
was making on a leaf of his pocketbook.</p>

<p>It was the plan for the house.</p>

<p>He had made the sketch more as an exercise for his
restless fingers than anything else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>Nothing could be more simple or rudimentary in
the way of a house plan. The drawing provided for
two rooms only, a big room and a little room. The
main door opened on to the big room.</p>

<p>"It won't be much of a house," said the architect, as
he showed the drawing, "but still it will be a house, and
a house is a most important thing for us. Shelter!
I'd just as soon shelter in the tent; sooner, but it's
not a question of shelter so much as prestige. It's like
wearing a clean shirt. You see, if we live the same as
our men they'll get to think of us as the same, whereas
if we live in a house and keep them under canvas, or
in any old huts they are able to make, they think of us
accordingly. The house gets on their mind. It is
the symbol of authority and power. It becomes the
government building. There's a whole lot in that&mdash;more
than you would think. Then, besides, we want
a secure place for the pearls. It won't do to keep them
under canvas or in a hole in the ground. I'm going to
build as strong as I can and make the door to match.
We will have loopholes to fire through, in case of eventualities,
though I don't think they'll be needed.</p>

<p>"The man who has to depend on defending his position
by resisting attack in his own house is a pretty
bad administrator.</p>

<p>"Still one never knows what may happen, and it is
as well to be prepared."</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>MOSTLY ABOUT PEARLS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> took them a fortnight to get the main posts up and
the planking started.</p>

<p>Joe proved himself an invaluable worker, with initiative
enough to oversee the others, so that both Schumer
and Floyd could leave him and give their attention
to the fishery and the pearl getting. Sru, despite his
looks and his scars, was shaping well also as an overseer,
and the pearls were showing in a satisfactory
manner. The pearls taken hitherto by Schumer and
Floyd working alone were all free pearls contained in
the substance of the oyster or lying loose under the
mantle; now began to come in pearls attached to the
shell and shells presenting blisters.</p>

<p>It was well that Schumer had some practical knowledge
of pearling, or these blistered shells might have
been cast with the others.</p>

<p>Now a blister on a pearl shell looks exactly like the
bleb raised by a blister on the human skin. It is
caused by some foreign body getting into the oyster,
causing irritation, and a consequent extra secretion of
nacre which covers the foreign body over. But it must
never be forgotten also that a pearl lying in the shell
may cause sufficient irritation to stimulate this extra
secretion of nacre, and that, as a result, a blister when
opened may be found to contain a pearl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>At the end of a month, when the house was nearly
finished, they had on their hands two dozen of these
blistered shells and a hundred and four pearls as the
result of the month's fishing, besides eighteen shells
to which pearls were adhering.</p>

<p>On paper that would seem to make a good show,
but the practical results were not so rosy, though fair
enough in all conscience, considering the cheap price
of labor.</p>

<p>To arrive at a true estimate of the take one must
disregard Schumer's rough statement as to values for
something more precise.</p>

<p>The most valuable of all pearls are those that are
<i>perfectly round</i>.</p>

<p>A perfect pearl must have this shape, and it must
have four other qualities. It must be either pure white
or pink; it must be partly transparent; it must be free
from all specks or blemishes, and it must have the true
pearl luster.</p>

<p>Next to the perfect comes the Bouton pearl, flat on
one side and convex on the other; lastly comes the drop
or pear-shaped pearl.</p>

<p>All these belong to the first class, and if they conform
to the four cardinal rules as to transparency,
<i>et cetera</i>, they are valuable, the value of each depending
upon the weight in grains.</p>

<p>Then come the second class, consisting of imperfectly
shaped pearls of good luster and quality and
perfectly shaped pearls of imperfect luster and quality.</p>

<p>Lastly we have the baroque pearls.</p>

<p>These are sometimes of very large size, but of extraordinary
and irregular shape. They are really
masses of nacre that have been formed around large,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
rough foreign bodies that have got into the oyster.
They are sometimes hollow, and then they are known
to jewelers under the French name <i>coq de perle</i>.</p>

<p>Now of the hundred and four free pearls taken in
the month's fishing only six were absolutely perfect and
only two of these of large size. Yet these two alone
well repaid the labor of getting them. Of the other
ninety-eight there were twenty baroques of small value,
and of the remaining seventy-eight, twenty were estimated
by Schumer to be worthless, the last fifty-eight
varying in value from half a sovereign to four pounds.</p>

<p>Taken altogether, the catch was good, especially
when the blistered shells were split, for in two of the
twenty-four blisters a pearl was found of fair quality.
The cavities of the remaining "blisters" revealed nothing
but some discolored water that smelled horribly.</p>

<p>Beside the pearls taken the value of the shell had
also to be reckoned. The shell was that known to
commerce as golden-edged, and its value might have
been anything from fifty to a hundred pounds a ton.</p>

<p>When I spoke of twenty of the pearls being worthless
I referred less to the pearls than the remains of
pearls; every healthy pearl is of some value, even down
to the tiny seed pearl, but the pearl, no matter how
large, that loses its beauty by disease is worthless.</p>

<p>It is the grief of pearl fishing to come across things
that a year ago may have been worth anything from a
couple of hundred to a thousand pounds and that to-day
are worthless. Things as ugly as dead cod's eyes
that, a year ago, were fit to be the symbols of beauty,
and it is impossible to say exactly what causes this decay.
There may be several causes, diseases that attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the pearl as well as the oyster; but the result is there
as a proof of the vandalism of nature.</p>

<p>Among the trade of the <i>Tonga</i> had been some parcels
of surgeons' cotton wool. Schumer rooted a parcel
of this out, and, turning the gold and papers from
the cash box, lined it with a sheet of the wool. He
placed the baroque and lesser-valued pearls on this
sheet and covered them with a single layer of wool;
on this layer he placed the pearls of the second order.
All those of the first class he kept apart in a small
wooden box, each pearl packed separately in its own
nest of wool.</p>

<p>The few shells with pearls attached to them he
placed in a cocoa box, each shell in a jacket of wool.</p>

<p>"We can't cut the pearls off those shells," said he.
"It's jeweler's work, and we are only carpenters at
the business. They'll keep till we get them to Europe."</p>

<p>A fortnight later the roof was on the house, a roof
thatched with palm leaves bound down with coconut
sennit, and the pearls and all their other valuables were
placed in the smaller of the two rooms.</p>

<p>The indefatigable Schumer, immediately the main
door was in its place, set his men to work making a
table. The two deck chairs were brought from the
<i>Southern Cross</i>, also a spare saloon lamp and some
drums of paraffin oil. Otherwise the schooner was
left intact.</p>

<p>"Those Hakluyts would be sure to make a disturbance
if we touched any of the saloon furniture," said
Schumer. "They'd swear, maybe, we had looted the
ship, and it's my ambition to bring her into Sydney harbor
with everything standing and without a scratch on
her that a Jew could swear to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>"Schumer," said Floyd, "I've been thinking of that.
When do you intend that we should take her to Sydney?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, "now we have things fixed
the sooner we make a move the better. At first glance
one might say keep her here till we have finished with
the lagoon and then shin off in her with all the pearls
we can get. That's what a fool would say, and that's
what a fool would do. Where lies the folly? This
way.</p>

<p>"To keep her like that would mean to steal her, and,
as I said before, you can't steal a ship these days without
being caught. Suppose, even, we were to give all
the ports in the world good-by and wreck her, where
would we be with our pearls on some desolate shore,
or if on a civilized shore, where would be the customs
officers?</p>

<p>"No. Pearls aren't worth two cents without a
market for them, and we must get to Sydney, not only
to claim salvage on the schooner and maybe to get the
Hakluyts to let us rent her, but to make the beginning
of a market for our stuff. We'll <i>have</i> to bring some
one else into the affair. I wish we hadn't. I've been
figuring on every means of getting out of it, but I can't
find a way."</p>

<p>"How are we to leave the fishery here to itself while
we go to Sydney?"</p>

<p>"We can't do that; one of us must stay to look after
things."</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, "if that is so I know which is
the one that will have to stay&mdash;and that is myself."</p>

<p>"It's a strange thing," said Schumer rather grimly,
"but I had come to the same conclusion. I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
undervalue you in the least, as you very well know.
I try to attach the right values to all things and people.
It's the only way to arrive at success&mdash;but your value
as a negotiator of this business is negligible simply
because you have no knowledge of trade, and&mdash;if you
will excuse me for saying so&mdash;no stomach for it. If
Hakluyt is the man I imagine him to be he'd turn you
inside out, pearls and all, inside two minutes, gobble
the pearls and throw away the skin. No, I must go
and deal with him personally, and you must stay here
and look after the fishing, but I don't propose to start
yet, till we have the thing more fully in hand."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Floyd, "why not take the
schooner back to Sydney, sell what pearls we have got
there, and then, with the money they bring and the
money we have already, charter another schooner for
our work. In that way we would keep the matter in
our own hands."</p>

<p>"One would think," said Schumer, "from the way
you talk, that pearls were to be sold as easy as dairy
produce. Sydney is the last place I would sell pearls
openly in, and the very last place I would try to sell
them secretly in. Paris is the market for pearls, or
London. Besides, you must remember that Sydney is
a sort of center for pearling in the Australian Pacific,
and if wind got about of our island, we would be
dogged to a certainty.</p>

<p>"No, we simply have to get help, and it's better to
have one man with money as our partner than half
a dozen interlopers crying: 'Share  up, or we'll give
the business away.' Of course," finished Schumer
meditatively, "we could use our guns against them, but
those sorts don't go unarmed, and we are only two,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
for the natives don't count. As like as not, they'd turn
against us from the first, and they'd certainly do so if
they saw us being beaten."</p>

<p>They had been sitting under a tree as they talked,
close to the nearly completed house, and, as Schumer
finished, Floyd saw Isbel coming across the lagoon
from the fishing grounds in the schooner's dinghy.</p>

<p>The dinghy of the <i>Southern Cross</i> was a tiny affair,
even for a boat of this type. It held two at a pinch,
and its lines were the lines of a walnut shell. It was
a dainty little boat, and had evidently belonged to a
yacht at some time or another, to judge by its fittings,
or what was left of them.</p>

<p>Isbel was standing up and sculling with a single oar
from the stern.</p>

<p>"I say," said Schumer, "what has that girl been doing
over at the fishing ground?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Floyd, shading his eyes; "didn't
know she had gone there. She must have gone to the
schooner and taken the dinghy."</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "that won't do. I don't
want her palling up with those labor hands; they are
her own people, and she knows a lot too much about us
and our affairs to let her get thick with them. She
knows where all the trade is cached, for one thing.
Besides, she hasn't been the same for a long while. I
can't get a word out of her."</p>

<p>"She has been different ever since you hanged that
chap," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Well, she'll have to change her tune, or she'll see
the rough side of me," replied the other. "I'm not
going to stand any Kanaka tricks, and I've shown them
that already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>"Seems to me," said Floyd, "that all you have done
by that hanging business is to turn Isbel against us."</p>

<p>Schumer did not reply. He was walking down to
the lagoon edge at the point where the little boat was
preparing to beach.</p>

<p>"Hi," cried he, "what have you been doing in that
boat?"</p>

<p>"Been to the fishing grounds," replied the girl, as
the dinghy took the sand and she stepped out into a
foot of water and helped Schumer to haul the boat up;
"been to see the men; they are my people."</p>

<p>"Oh, they are your people, are they?" said Schumer.
"Well, you mustn't go to them; we want you
here. And it seems to me we are your people, too.
You have been with us long enough on the island to
make you one of us, and yet you go off at the first
chance to your people, as you call them."</p>

<p>She said nothing; she did not look in his face.</p>

<p>Floyd, standing by, watched her. She had brought
the scull ashore; she was holding it in her hand, and, as
she stood there in the scanty white cotton garment that
fitted her with the grace that only comes from the
wearer, he thought what a pretty picture she made
against the blazing lagoon and far-off reef.</p>

<p>"Remember," went on Schumer, "that you are one
of us, and belong to the island, that we have helped
you just as you have helped us, and that though you
have always been treated with kindness, I can punish
those who disobey me."</p>

<p>Floyd, as he listened and watched, thought that he
perceived the faintest curl of her lip at this latter
clause, but he could not be sure; that inscrutable, yet
childish, face was very difficult to read, and more espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>cially
now as she raised her eyes to those of Schumer.</p>

<p>"I will not use your boat again," said she; "it was
only the little one. Do you want me any more now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Schumer, turning away. "I have nothing
more to say."</p>

<p>She put the scull back in the boat, shaded her eyes,
and looked over the lagoon toward the fishing ground,
as though at some place where her heart was, but her
body could not be.</p>

<p>Floyd, as he went off to superintend the house-builders,
shook his head.</p>

<p>The three of them had been almost a little family
before this had taken place. The pearls were dividing
them already. Isbel had become a stranger to him,
and to-morrow Schumer might be his enemy.</p>

<small>PLANS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> evening, a fortnight later, Schumer, who had
just come back from the fishing camp, found
Floyd seated on the sand near the house and engaged
in mending some tackle. He took his seat beside him,
lit a pipe, and gave him news of the day's work.</p>

<p>"Everything is shipshape here now," finished he,
"and it's time to strike for Sydney."</p>

<p>"When do you propose to start?"</p>

<p>"At once."</p>

<p>"At once?"</p>

<p>"Why not? There are stores enough on the <i>Southern
Cross</i> for the trip, and it's only a question of getting
the water on board; that will take us a day. The
weather promises well, and I'd propose to start the
day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>Floyd said nothing for a moment. The projected
expedition that would leave him alone on the island
had weighed on his mind for the last few days. Whatever
Schumer might be, he was a companion, the only
other white man in the place. To be left absolutely
alone, with no one to talk to, was a dreary prospect,
but it was for the good of the business, and he was
not the man to grumble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>"Well," he said, "if it has to be, there is no use
talking. We can't both leave the place, and since you
are the best man for the trade end of the affair, I must
stop, but it will be a pretty lonely business."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll find lots to do," said Schumer, laughing.
"I only hope you won't find too much. I have
drilled these fellows into pretty fair discipline, and
it's for you to keep it up. I warn you if you don't
you'll have trouble. You mustn't let them come any
of the funny business over you, and you must back your
authority with your gun if need be. Your only danger
is the cache. We give these fellows tobacco and so
on, and the question hasn't begun to enter their thick
heads as to where all the stores come from, but it may,
and if they scent the cache, there will be trouble. You
just remember that knives and trade goods are like
minted gold to these chaps, and if they suspected a
whole Bank of England of them here under the trees,
they'd ten to one try to raid it. You mustn't ever let
them land here."</p>

<p>"You bet I won't," said Floyd. "How long will
you be gone?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks to get there and three to get back,
makes six weeks, and allowing for a fortnight there&mdash;let's
say nine weeks to give it a margin. You may
expect me back in the lagoon in nine weeks. If I'm
not back by then, you may begin to suspect I'm with
the sharks."</p>

<p>"You will take the money with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course; and I'll take the best of the pearls, too,
for several reasons. First to show our samples, second
because I'm leaving you the lagoon. If I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
come back, you'd have the lagoon, and if you bolted
with the lagoon, I'd have the pearls.</p>

<p>"I won't take all the pearls, only a selection of the
best."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind," said Floyd. "I can trust you;
and, even if I couldn't, you would not be such a fool as
to leave a pearl lagoon for the sake, of a six weeks'
take of pearls. Well, come on to supper; there's Isbel
laying out the things; we can talk afterward."</p>

<p>Though the house was now finished, with the door
on, and the table in, they always took their meals in
the open. Isbel had laid the plates and knives and
forks on a cloth before the door, and in the center of
the cloth a kava bowl with some flowers in it.</p>

<p>Schumer was always very punctilious as to the service
of meals, laying the cloth himself if no one else
were there to do it. He had salved all the <i>Tonga</i>
linen, and he would doubtless have insisted on napkins
had the <i>Tonga</i> carried them; unable to go as far as
napkins, he had contented himself with flowers. He
believed in keeping up appearances, even if there were
no one to observe these appearances but their two selves
and Isbel, and he was right. Slackness is one of the
rots of the world, and the least bit of ceremonial is
the finest tonic in life.</p>

<p>Isbel, who never ate with them now by any chance,
and who had voluntarily debased herself from the position
of companion to the condition of servant, went
off and left them to their food. The sun sank behind
the reef, and in a sky of pansy blue the first vague
sketch of the constellation began to show itself to the
darkening sea. Then almost as though touched off
by a taper, the stars blazed out, crusting with light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the whole dome from the sea line to the zenith. It was
the night before the new moon, and always on these
nights when the whole lighting of the world was left
to the stars a deeper peace seemed to pervade the
island and the ocean and the sky. The voice of the
reef seemed to sink lower, and the night wind to blow
warmer, and the lagoon to hold in its depths a profounder
calm.</p>

<p>The wind to-night brought faint odors of vanilla
and frangipanni from the trees of the grove, and
across the lagoon a trace of song from the camping
place by the fishing ground. The natives were amusing
themselves, and the light of their camp fire showed
like a red spark across the starlit water.</p>

<p>The two men on the beach sat smoking and watching
the schooner as she rode to her anchor, with a
single light showing. The Kanaka crew, whom Schumer
had always kept apart from the labor men, were
on deck, and their forms could be seen indistinctly in
the starlight as they lounged about, smoking and yarning.
A fellow was fishing over the after rail, and now
and then one could see a splash in the water and a
streak of silver, as a groper was hauled up.</p>

<p>Faint and far away and coming, no doubt, from
the fo'c'sle could be heard the strains of a concertina
playing a thready and wandering air, while occasionally
across the lagoon from the deep soundings came
the splash of a great fish jumping, while the ring of
it spread in a circle of silver on the water.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>SCHUMER GOES AWAY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">They</span> got the water on board next day, and the
day following they were up before dawn to
catch the slack of the tide which was due an hour
after sunrise. It would then be still water at the break
in the reef.</p>

<p>Schumer had made all his last preparations the night
before. He would breakfast on board the schooner
when she was free of the lagoon, and as Floyd rowed
him across in the dinghy, the sky over the eastern
reef was paling, and the stars above, that had been
leaping all night like hearts of fire, showed signs of
the coming day.</p>

<p>When Schumer was on board, Floyd pushed off
again, having wished him good luck, and then hung on
his oars half a cable length away, watching the preparations
for departure.</p>

<p>He could hear Schumer's voice giving orders, and
the bare feet of the fellows on deck running forward
to the capstan.</p>

<p>"Break down," came the order, and following it
the chorus of the Kanakas mixed with the rasp of the
anchor chain as the slack of it came in, till the order
was given, "Vast leaving."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>All sound now ceased, and at that moment, just as
the first light of day was striking the palm fronds and
the topmost spars of the <i>Southern Cross</i>, the schooner,
riding at her taut anchor chain, seemed the ghost of a
ship stricken suddenly into unreality by the profound
silence that had suddenly fallen upon her. A moment
passed, and then the voice of Schumer came again,
ordering the hands to set the mainsail, and to haul on
the throat and peak halyards.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a trace of morning bank in the
east, and the light, now strengthening rapidly, showed
the great trapezium of canvas slatting to the faint and
favorable wind. Then the foresail took the breeze,
dusky forms swarming on the jib boom were casting
the gaskets off the jib, now the men on deck were hauling
at the jib halyards, and just as a horse answers to
the pull of the bit, the <i>Southern Cross</i> veered round to
the pressure of the sail, while the voice of Schumer
came again, ordering the anchor to be hove up.</p>

<p>As it left the water and rose to the cathead, the
schooner, with way on already, began to steal toward
the reef opening, the first rays of the sun turning her
canvas to vague gold against the new-born blue of the
sky.</p>

<p>The form of Schumer appeared for a moment at the
after rail and waved a hand, then it vanished, and
Floyd, having watched the <i>Southern Cross</i> make her
first bow to the swell of the outside sea, returned to
the shore.</p>

<p>He hauled the dinghy up, and then, climbing across
the coral to the break in the reef, watched the dwindling
sail, till the sun dazzle half blinded him. Then
he turned away and sought the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>The two men had used the main room of the house
for sleeping in at night, a bunk mattress taken from the
<i>Southern Cross</i> being placed in each corner, and removed
in the daytime to the smaller room. Floyd,
without waiting for Isbel's help, removed the mattresses,
and then began to wash and shave. The trade
room of the <i>Tonga</i> had supplied them with all toilet
necessaries, even to scissors, and its saloon had given
them a mirror; as Floyd's eyes fell now on the scissors
he recalled the fact that Schumer had been his hair
cutter, even as he had been Schumer's. Well, it would
be nine weeks before he would have the chance of a
haircut, unless he could press Sru into the business.
The thought of this made him laugh as he left the
house and came out on the beach.</p>

<p>Isbel had lit the fire and laid the breakfast things.
She was turning away when he stopped her.</p>

<p>"Schumer is gone," said he; "he has taken the ship
and gone away, but he will be back in a little time."</p>

<p>"He will be back&mdash;&mdash;" She broke off the sentence
and raised her eyes to his, and though she was gazing
full at him, she did not seem to see him. She seemed
looking at something a hundred miles away, and the
sensation of being gazed through as though he were
clear as glass, and absolutely negligible, gave Floyd a
queer sensation&mdash;almost a shiver.</p>

<p>"In a while," said he. "What ails you, Isbel&mdash;what
have I done to you that has altered you so? We
used to be good friends. It was not my fault, that
trouble with one of your people; he had killed a man.
He had committed murder, and the man who commits
murder must die."</p>

<p>Isbel listened to him just as though she were listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ing
to the sound of the sea or the wind, with the same
far-away look, the same air of abstraction. Then she
said, speaking not in answer to him, but as though she
were making a statement about some ordinary matter:</p>

<p>"I have no peace here. I wish to go to my own
people. Schumer will come back, but he will not find
me."</p>

<p>"Hello!" said Floyd. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>But she would say nothing more; she would not even
look him again in the face, and, irritated at last, he
turned away and sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>If Schumer were to come back and not find her,
where on earth did she propose to go? What did she
mean? For a moment the horrid idea occurred to him
that she might intend suicide; then he dismissed it;
Isbel was not the sort of person to commit self-murder
without any appreciable cause; though mysterious
enough, she was too healthy and sane for that folly.
All the same, as he breakfasted, her words kept ringing
in his head:</p>

<p>"Schumer will come back, but he will not find me."</p>

<p>"God knows," thought he, "it will be hard enough
here all alone without her bolting off or doing something
foolish&mdash;anyhow, there is nowhere for her to bolt
to, unless she bolts into the lagoon&mdash;confound Schumer
and his methods. If he had left that chap alone, she
would not have taken this dead set against us."</p>

<p>When he had finished breakfast, he went to the
pierhead at the break on the reef and swept the sea
line with his eyes. Away, far away, like a flake of
white spar, a sail showed against the sky. It was
the <i>Southern Cross</i>, almost hull down on the horizon.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE FIRST OF THE TWO PEARLS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">He</span> came back to the beach.</p>

<p>Schumer had left him two boats, the dinghy
and the boat of the <i>Cormorant</i>. They were both on
the beach, and as the dinghy was the easiest to launch
single-handed, he used it and pushed off to the fishing
ground.</p>

<p>The gulls started after him from the reef opening,
and now their voices came singly, mewing and miauling,
the very voice of desolation itself.</p>

<p>Looking back as he rowed, he could see the figure
of Isbel; she was putting things straight about the
house, and just at that moment, as if stirred by the
loneliness and the voices of the gulls, his heart went
out to her. She was the only live thing in all that place
for him. There were living things&mdash;fish in the lagoon
and Kanaka laborers on the reef&mdash;but Isbel was the
only warm spot for his mind to cling to.</p>

<p>The child had differentiated herself from her surroundings.
By some extraordinary magic she had,
without effort and almost without speech, pushed the
image of Schumer to one side, and the forms of the
Kanakas to the other.</p>

<p>Schumer, despite his powerful personality, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
a dead thing beside Isbel, and the Kanakas, powerful
and brawny as they were, seemed puppets&mdash;things of
mechanism&mdash;fantoccini. What was the magic property
that gave her the ascendency in the mind of
Floyd?</p>

<p>For one thing, Isbel, despite her silence, her self-isolation,
and the other-world atmosphere with which she
surrounded herself, had always proved herself sterling.</p>

<p>Never had she failed them in any least particular,
every humble duty that had fallen to her she had carried
out honestly, and no paid servant could have
worked more industriously in their interests.</p>

<p>Like Schumer, she had a strong personality that
spoke in her actions and her movements. Unlike
Schumer, her personality remained with one even in
her absence. She was a good memory and a living
memory. Schumer, in his absence&mdash;despite his wonderful
personality&mdash;was only the recollection of a
strong man absent.</p>

<p>That is all the difference between the mechanical
and the vital, between the grip of iron and the grip of
flesh.</p>

<p>Then she was a woman, or at least the germ of a
woman; she was graceful, she was pretty as a wild
flower, and, above all, she was an unknown factor, a
hint of strangeness, the suggestion of a being from another
star.</p>

<p>As he rowed, widening the distance between himself
and the camping place, he was considering Isbel in all
her aspects; the absence of Schumer and the loneliness
and isolation of his own position had thrown her, so
to speak, into the arms of his mind. He was consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>ing
also the fatal effect that had followed on the sight
of the hanging. She had never been the same since
that. The deed had stricken division between them,
had called up all the barriers of race which she had
expressed in those memorable words: "I have no rest
here. I wish to go back to my own people." When
he reached the fishing ground, he found the work in
full swing under the supervision of Sru.</p>

<p>That gentleman was seated on a coral lump, smoking,
and the lagoon, close to the shore, was occupied
by what might have seemed, at first sight, a bathing
party.</p>

<p>They did not use a boat now; they had constructed
a raft, and all round the raft bobbed the heads of the
pearl fishers, while on the raft itself several more were
stretched, sunning themselves and smoking. All were
stark naked and seemed happy as children.</p>

<p>Sru alone was garbed, and his simple dress consisted
of a G string.</p>

<p>Sru saluted Floyd as the boat approached, and left
his seat to help in beaching her; then he stood by
Floyd as the latter inspected the few shells that had
been taken already that morning. Sru was the only
one of the working party who could talk in English,
and though his conversation was as scanty as his G
string, he could make himself understood.</p>

<p>As Floyd conversed with this man, he experienced
a new sensation. Schumer had done the overseeing
of the overseer up to this; Floyd had never come
closely in contact with the men, and now, as he stood
on the burning beach, almost in touch with Sru, he
felt as though he were standing in touch with some
man of the stone age and the silurian beaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>The whites of Sru's eyes had a yellow tinge, and
the glint of his teeth as he raised his lip was like a
gleam of ivory reflected from a million years ago, the
scars on his breast and arms, seen close to like this,
had a deep significance, and the smell of him, hot, gorse-like,
and faintly goatlike, was the smell of all fierce
and savage things, hinted at and vaguely expressed.
The John Tan plug he was smoking lent its fierce perfume
to the natural scent of him, and he spat between
his teeth and grumbled in his throat when he was not
talking.</p>

<p>Sru was a revelation when you found yourself close
to him like this, under the sun on a desolate beach, and
with civilization thousands of miles away.</p>

<p>After a while Floyd ordered the raft to be brought
to the beach edge, and, getting on to it, pushed out to
inspect the work of the divers.</p>

<p>Oysters do not lie flat at the bottom of the sea; they
lean with mouths agape at an angle of twenty to twenty-five
degrees with the sea floor. The great clams do
likewise. Floyd, looking down, could see the men
who had just dived groping along the bottom, skylarking
as they worked. One fellow who was in the act
of rising with a couple of shells which he had secured,
was caught by the foot by a companion. He dropped
the shells and retaliated, the pair coming to the surface,
bursting with want of air and suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>As Schumer said, they were like children, and their
work had a large element of play in it. Still, they
worked after their fashion, wet hands continually
seizing the raft edge and depositing the dripping shells
on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>Although the quickest way of dealing with oysters
in the mass is by rotting them, the search for pearls can
be conducted on oysters fresh from the sea, and
Floyd, as he sat on the raft, amused himself by opening
some of the shells with his pocketknife, choosing the
largest for this purpose. He found no pearls, but
plenty of surprises. Nearly every large oyster in the
southern seas gives shelter to a "messmate." A little
crab, a small lobster, a worm, or a shrimp, lives in the
shell along with the host. In some fisheries, as down
in Sooloo, lobsters are only found, but here, as Floyd
opened shell after shell, there was always something
new&mdash;now a crab, now a worm, now a harmless creature,
half shrimp, half crawfish.</p>

<p>Tiring of the business at last, he put ashore and
turned his attention to the heap of shell "ripe" and
gaping, putrid from exposure to the air, and waiting
to be searched for pearls. He had got so used to
the business now that it was scarcely unpleasant. Sru
and one of the hands assisted him, and the work went
forward without result for an hour, not even a seed
pearl appearing in all the slimy mess carefully washed
out in the trough of the canvas.</p>

<p>Schumer seemed to have taken the luck away with
him. They knocked off for a rest and a smoke, and
then went at it again with, as a final result of their
morning's labor, a baroque pearl about the size of a
sixpence, and a pearl of indifferent luster and weighing
about ten grains.</p>

<p>"No good," said Sru, with a grunt of dissatisfaction;
"heap few, heap big work."</p>

<p>"Heap plenty, maybe soon," replied Floyd, turning
away. He felt depressed without the least reason for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
being so. No one knew better than he the uncertainties
of this work, and how much it approximates to
gambling. It was, perhaps, the feeling that Schumer
had taken the luck away with him that caused the depression.
Want of success is never inspiriting; actual
defeat is a better tonic for the mind. He placed the
morning's catch in the box he carried for the purpose,
and, getting in the boat, rowed back to the encampment.</p>

<p>Work was never carried on during the middle of
the day, and it was not till three o'clock in the afternoon
that he returned.</p>

<p>Isbel had prepared his midday meal for him, and
he left her behind, putting things in order. He had
scarcely spoken to her, judging that in her present
humor it was better to say nothing and trust to time
and the absence of Schumer to soothe her feelings. He
knew little of the mentality of Isbel. Arrived at the
fishing grounds, he set to with Sru on a heap of shells
that lay awaiting treatment.</p>

<p>The size of the oysters to be dealt with varied considerably.
Nothing, indeed, varies much more than
the size of the pearl oysters as taken in the different
fisheries of the world. In some places the oysters are
so small that from three to four thousand go to make
a ton; in others they are so large that a ton weight of
them only runs to four or five hundred. Occasionally
gigantic specimens are obtained, weighing from fourteen
to sixteen pounds, bare shells.</p>

<p>The largest of these oysters being handled by Floyd
and Sru would have scaled a thousand to the ton, perhaps,
and the medium size about fifteen hundred.</p>

<p>The afternoon work was scarcely more fruitful than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the morning. It began with the capture of two small,
but almost perfect, pearls, globular in shape, but weighing,
perhaps, less than fifteen grains. These were
taken in the first fifteen minutes, and then for the next
three hours nothing showed but slush and slime.</p>

<p>The oysters one after the other were cleared out
into the canvas trough with a sweep of the finger.
Each pair of shells were then examined for adhering
pearls or blisters, and flung aside if showing neither.
Then, when sufficient putrefying matter had been collected
in the troughs, it was carefully washed away and
searched.</p>

<p>The shells cast aside were collected by two of the
men and stored.</p>

<p>It was just at sunset, and at the washing of the last
lot, that Floyd, groping in the seaweed-colored and viscous
mass in the trough, felt his fingers closing upon a
pebble. From the size of the object, he fancied for
a second that it was a pebble. Instantly, and before he
had brought it to light, he knew it to be a pearl.</p>

<p>It was. A perfectly round pearl, of enormous size,
at least enormous in comparison with all the pearls
he had hitherto seen. But it was not till he had
cleansed it of slime in the bucket of water which Sru
held for him that he saw what a prize he had obtained.</p>

<p>It was near sunset, and the golden light, mellow and
tremulous, that was illuminating the sea and turning
the west to flame, lit the treasure lying in the palm of
his hand.</p>

<p>It was a pink pearl, exquisite, lustrous, and almost,
one might say, luminous. It was the size of a marble.
Not one of those enormous glass marbles with colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
cores which we all remember as objects of worship,
but an ordinary, practicable, play-with-able marble of
full size.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>Sru grunted.</p>

<p>To Sru all this lust for pearls was an inexplicable
business. If it had been a hunt for colored beads, he
could have understood it, but pearls to him had no
more beauty than cod's eyes, and far less beauty than
colored shells. Coming from a district where pearling
was unknown, he had no idea, either, of the value of
these things.</p>

<p>But even to Sru the new find was pleasing, because
of its color, the vague luminous pink, the luster, the
semi-translucency, and the perfect shape of the thing
pleased him.</p>

<p>But they did not excite him. He could not understand
that the lump of colored nacre that weighed,
perhaps, two hundred grains, and was worth, perhaps,
five thousand pounds, was the equivalent of mountains
of plug tobacco, shiploads of cotton stuff, knives, guns,
and ammunition, oceans of gin.</p>

<p>Floyd, after his momentary exclamation, controlled
himself, turned the thing over in his hand as though
it were some ordinary object, and then put it in the
pearl box, carefully covering it with the cotton wool.
He put the box in the pocket of his coat, which lay
near by, and turned again to the searching of the last
remnants of stuff in the trough. Nothing more
showed, and, having washed his hands in the canvas
bucket which Sru held for him, he put on his coat, and,
having given him some directions as to the storing of
the shell, returned across the lagoon to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>He knew that what he had in his pocket was worth
all the stuff they had taken from the lagoon. Schumer
had educated him on the subject of pearls, but
even Schumer, with all his knowledge, could not have
fixed the value of this splendid find, perfect in all parts,
and weighing at least a hundred grains.</p>

<p>After supper he took it out of its box and examined
it by the light of the fire. It was even more beautiful
by the glow of the burning sticks than by the glow
of the sunset.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE VANISHING OF ISBEL</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, when Floyd came out on the beach,
he could not find Isbel.</p>

<p>He called to her, and there was no reply; then he
started off to hunt for her in the grove, but she was
not there.</p>

<p>He went to the seaward side of the reef; the breakers
were falling and the gulls flying, but there was no
sign of Isbel. She had vanished as completely as
though she had never been. Floyd, in perplexity,
shaded his eyes and gazed toward the sea line, as
though he fancied some ship might have come and
taken her off, but the sea line was as empty as the sea,
and the only thing visible away out there was a frigate
bird sailing on the wind.</p>

<p>The bird was passing the island with supreme indifference,
traveling under the dominion of some
steady purpose, and heading for some destination, perhaps
half a thousand miles away. It dwindled in the
blue, and Floyd, turning, took his way back to the
beach.</p>

<p>The dinghy and quarter boat were still there, otherwise
he might have fancied that she had gone to the
fishing camp; the thing seemed inexplicable, and trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to put it from his mind, he set to on the preparations
for breakfast. He lit the fire and put some water on
to boil, opened some canned stuff, and then, having set
a plate and knife and fork, made the coffee. He did
all this automatically, working by instinct and habit,
and almost heedless of what he was doing. A great
desolation had fallen upon him, and a great fear, and
in the midst of this desolation and fear something was
calling out to him, a voice he had never heard before.</p>

<p>With the food untasted before him, he sat with his
chin on his hands, gazing at the beach, white in the
burning sunshine, and across the water of the lagoon,
blue and ruffled by the morning wind.</p>

<p>Isbel, from the very first, had been for him a pleasing
figure, quaint and with something of mystery about
it. He did not know till now how much of his subconscious
life she had occupied, nor how much he had
really cared for her. She had grown on him till he
had come to love her; that was the fact, and a fact that
he recognized now in the pain and fear and desolation
of his heart.</p>

<p>It was the strangest and rarest form of love, this
love of his for Isbel. The love of a lonely man for a
flower, or a child, and with just the hint of the love of
a man for a woman.</p>

<p>She was the germ of a woman, and by just that extent
did the bond of sex hold him to her.</p>

<p>His life had been very lonely. Right up from his
boyhood he had lived pretty much uncared for. He
had made friendships, but the wandering life of the
sea breaks ties just as it casts away lives; he had no
home, no family, and the men he had grown to care
for, old chums and messmates, were like the gulls&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>once
parted from and lost to sight, never to be found
again.</p>

<p>As he sat like this, on the wind which was setting
across the lagoon from the fishing ground, came a
snatch of song from the fishermen who were at work.</p>

<p>He rose up, and, leaving the food still untasted,
came down to the water's edge and, pushing the dinghy
off, got into her and sculled across to the camp.</p>

<p>He had some thought of telling his trouble to Sru,
and some vague idea of seeking help from him. Never
for a moment had the idea come to him that Isbel
might have joined the fishing camp.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible for her to have got there across
the rough coral of the reef, and equally impossible
across the lagoon. Yet when he landed, the first object
that caught his eye was Isbel. She was seated in
front of one of the tents engaged in shredding some
coconut pulp into a bowl, and when she saw him she
did not seem at all put out.</p>

<p>She had gone back to her own people, literally, and
to look at her he might have fancied she had never
parted from them. Floyd nodded to her. He could
have laughed aloud in the relief of seeing her safe and
sound; she nodded in return, and went on with her
work. She did not seem in the least put out or
ashamed of herself for having deserted him, and now
that his fears about her were removed, he felt irritated
at her coolness.</p>

<p>All the hard things that Schumer had said about
Kanakas rose up in his mind&mdash;"animals dressed in
human skin," "creatures without souls," and so forth.</p>

<p>But these sayings vanished from his mind almost
immediately. They had no clutch in them, simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
because they had no truth in them, and Isbel, as she
sat at work before the tent, formed their last antidote.</p>

<p>Never had she looked prettier than this morning,
seated there on a little mat, a fresh scarlet flower in her
hair, her feet tucked away, and her brown hands
busily at work.</p>

<p>Floyd came up to her.</p>

<p>"So there you are, Isbel," said he. "I did not
think you would have gone off and left me like that."</p>

<p>Isbel made no reply; she continued her work without
looking up; one might have fancied that she had
not heard him.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Floyd, "if you had told me, I
would not have tried to stop you. Why should I?
You are perfectly free here to do as you please. I
would even have brought you here myself in the boat.
How did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Along the reef," said Isbel, without looking up.</p>

<p>"Along the reef&mdash;why, you must have cut your feet
to pieces!"</p>

<p>For reply Isbel pushed a foot out from under her
robe.</p>

<p>It was a perfect little foot, honey-colored, perfect in
form, the toenails polished like agate. He had seen it
often before, but it seemed to him that he saw it now
for the first time. As he looked at it the toes spread
apart, and it was flexed and extended, as if to show
that it had sustained neither scratch nor injury. Then
it vanished.</p>

<p>"Well, you are cleverer than I am," said Floyd. He
would not stoop to question her as to how she had
negotiated the reef. If she did not choose to tell, why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
then let her keep silent. He turned on his heel and
walked off to where Sru was waiting for him. Then,
as they made for the place where the oysters were
lying ready to be examined, he glanced back; she had
vanished into the tent.</p>

<p>He said nothing to Sru on the matter, nor did the
foreman make any comment about the girl. They set
to on their task, working an hour without any result,
and then knocking off for a rest and a smoke.</p>

<p>It was during the second spell, and Floyd had just
turned to place the only take of the morning, a small
and nearly valueless pearl, in the box, which he carried
for the purpose, when their attention was drawn by
shouts from the fellows who were working in the
lagoon.</p>

<p>They had been shouting and splashing at their work,
but these outcries had a new note that brought Floyd
and Sru to their feet in a moment, and down to the
lagoon edge.</p>

<p>The dinghy, in which Floyd had come over, was
lying on the sand, with the incoming tide rippling up
to her; they pushed her off, reached the raft, and found
what was the matter.</p>

<p>One of the workers, Timau by name, while groping
along the bottom of the lagoon, had stepped into a
half-open clamshell, the shell had closed on his foot
like a trap, and he was a prisoner.</p>

<p>This is one of the most terrible accidents that can
happen to the pearl fisher. The great clam grows to
an enormous size, and, like the oyster, he does not lie
flat on the sea floor, but tilted at an angle of twenty-five
degrees or more. The sand, if there be much
sand where he lies, tends to silt round him and hide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
him, and so he lies, a veritable man-trap for the unwary.</p>

<p>The raft was crowded with men, all shouting, and
not one of them, seemingly, with the vestige of an idea
as to how they were to render assistance. Timau
could be seen clearly; he had fallen on his back, with
his right leg bent and the knee pointing upward; the
right foot was held by the terrific shell, whose contracting
muscles were powerful as iron bands.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more shocking than this seizure of
a man by a shellfish, this quiet destruction of the highest
form of life by the lowest form of intelligence.</p>

<p>The shark moves under the dominion of will, and
the cuttlefish knows at least hunger, but the great clam
is fed by the water that laves it, and its only expression
of will is to grip and hold whatever dares to violate its
sanctuary.</p>

<p>For a moment Floyd was as much at a loss as the
others; then he saw on the raft the iron bar used for
breaking down coral formations that were encroaching
on the beds. It was about two-thirds of the thickness
of an ordinary crowbar, and measured about three
feet in length.</p>

<p>He scrambled on to the raft, seized the bar, and
dived.</p>

<p>He was not wearing his coat, but otherwise he was
fully dressed; in the moment between seizing the bar
and diving he had thought out the whole plan of action.
The great clam, inclined to an angle of twenty
degrees, had to be pried open, and to do so the under
shell had to be brought level with the lagoon floor, so
as to obtain a purchase.</p>

<p>The watchers above saw him thrust the bar between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the shells, an act easy enough to accomplish, as they
were held four inches and more apart by the victim's
leg. This done, he inserted his booted foot as if to
tread down the under shell, while he levered up the
top shell.</p>

<p>He had reckoned on his weight being sufficient to
press down the shell, forgetting that a man weighed
in sea water scales very much less than a man weighed
in air. Yet, even so, he managed to reduce very considerably
the angle, and with a tremendous effort managed
to wrench the two shells apart.</p>

<p>He rose instantly, nearly bursting for want of air,
and as he rose the fellows on the raft, courageous
enough now, dived like one man to fetch up the body
of Timau.</p>

<p>They brought it to the raft, where Floyd was resting,
and hauled it on to the logs, while Floyd, on
hands and knees, examined it.</p>

<p>Timau seemed a very dead man. The right foot
and part of the leg was black and lacerated; there was
neither movement of heart nor sign of respiration, and
Sru, who had also bent down to examine him, rose up
with a grunt.</p>

<p>"Heap dead," said Sru; "no more fishing for Timau."</p>

<p>Floyd ordered them to push the raft ashore. This
having been done, he had the body laid out on the hot
sand, and started to work at once with artificial respiration.</p>

<p>He had to do the business alone, for not one of the
hands could understand what was required to be done,
nor would they have helped had they understood.
This was witch business; the man was dead and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>yond
recall; it was plainly against nature to try and
bring him back.</p>

<p>However, back he came. Floyd had been working
for some ten minutes when the first signs of returning
life showed themselves. Ten minutes later Timau
was leaning on his elbow, blinking at the world to
which he had returned, hiccuping and endeavoring to
speak.</p>

<p>Floyd had him carried up to the nearest tent and
laid on a mat. Then, with the help of Isbel, who had
suddenly appeared, he set to to dress the injured foot.
The lower end of the fibula was fractured, all the skin
over the lower part of the leg was lacerated and
bruised, and there was a nasty cut on the instep. They
laid wet cloths on the wounds, made a bandage over
them of coconut sennit, and left him so far recovered
that he was able to smoke a pipe.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE MIRACLE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Timau</span> made a good recovery. In a couple of
days he was hobbling about with the aid of a
stick, and in a week, but for the bandage on his foot
and leg, he seemed a well man.</p>

<p>He was also a distinguished personage in a way;
honored as a man returned from the grave, yet, at the
same time, avoided as much as possible. In other
words, he was feared, and he made the best of the
situation by doing no work and drawing full
allowances in food and tobacco.</p>

<p>He did not show the least outward gratitude toward
Floyd for his rescue and restoration, and Floyd, in his
turn, found himself somewhat in the same position as
Timau.</p>

<p>Sru, while working just the same, showed
considerable reserve in his dealings with his manager. A man
who could bring a corpse back to life was not a person
to be dealt with lightly, and the strange thing was, that
Floyd's beneficent action did not seem to strike Sru in
the light of beneficence. It was quite plainly evident
that it was looked upon more as an act of evil than of
good.</p>

<p>The other natives seemed of the same mind as Sru;
they never laughed and tom-fooled now when Floyd
was present&mdash;they worked better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>Isbel seemed quite unmoved. He saw her now
nearly every day when he came to the fishing camp;
she had quite settled down in her new home, and
seemed always busy, yet somehow to Floyd's eyes she
seemed changed. It was toward the first week of
Schumer's absence that Floyd became fully alive to this
change in her. She was no longer a child. Just as
some tropical plants bloom in a night, so in the course
of a few weeks she had changed, at least to his eyes.
It was as though a new person had come upon the
island.</p>

<p>But the miracle of the change in her had touched
him, too.</p>

<p>The whole world seemed suddenly altered. Life, in
a moment, had become a different thing. Life, in a
moment, had become worth living, the sky and sea
bluer, the sun more friendly, the island more beautiful.</p>

<p>Isbel had not changed the least in her manner
toward him, but the magic of life that had touched her
had touched him through her. She was always in his
thoughts&mdash;when he returned at night to the house, and
when he returned in the morning to the fishing ground,
when he lay awake at night and when he worked with
Sru by day.</p>

<p>He was in love, but he did not recognize the fact
for a long time, and even then he formed no plans and
dreamed no dreams after the fashion of lovers.</p>

<p>The idea of Isbel was enough, the sight of her, the
memory of her.</p>

<p>Had she shown by the faintest sign that she was
thinking of him, it would have been different. The will
to possess her would have at once arisen. But she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
showed nothing, living and moving as remote from
him as the moon that silvered the reef and shone upon
the water.</p>

<p>One morning Floyd, who ever since the departure of
Schumer had recorded the time by making a notch each
morning on the doorpost, completed the forty-ninth
notch. It was exactly seven weeks since Schumer's
departure. He had lost all record of the day of the
week. The <i>Cormorant</i> had been lost on a Wednesday,
and on landing he could easily have reckoned the day
by the time spent in the boat, but he had not troubled.
Schumer had also lost the day of the week, but the loss
affected them very little here, where even the hour of
the day was of small account.</p>

<p>"He ought to be back in a fortnight," said Floyd to
himself, as he sat down in the shadow of the house to
smoke a pipe before starting for the fishing ground.
"Wonder what luck he's had."</p>

<p>He sat smoking and reviewing the events that had
happened since Schumer's departure and the take of
pearls.</p>

<p>Since the capture of the pink pearl, luck had been
very uneven. All told, the take had amounted to a
hundred and five, leaving out seeds and worthless specimens.
Of these only twenty were of any considerable
size or value. There were also twenty-five blistered
shells, which Floyd had put aside to be dealt with by
Schumer.</p>

<p>The unevenness of the luck lay in the fact that during
some weeks the catch would be quite negligible,
during others quite good; some days would be blank,
while on the other hand three of the best had been
taken on the same day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>To-day was to prove lucky, for when he approached
the fishing ground, Sru approached him with a large
oyster in his hand.</p>

<p>The natives ate oysters sometimes, always cooking
them first, a strange thing, considering the fact that
they would eat fish not only raw, but living.</p>

<p>This was one of the oysters destined for food. It
had been opened, and when Sru reached Floyd, he
lifted the upper shell, and, putting his finger under the
mantel, raised it, disclosing a loose pearl.</p>

<p>It was as big as the great pink pearl, but of a virginal
white. Floyd had experienced many sensations in
life, but none so vividly pleasant as now at the sight
of this thing fresh from the lagoon, and in its strange
home.</p>

<p>The pink pearl had been fished out of a mess of
putrescence, but here was a gem handed to him as if by
the dripping hand of the sea.</p>

<p>He took the oyster, carefully extracted the pearl,
and held it in his palm, while Sru looked on, evidently
pleased with himself, and the other hands stood
around, glad of any opportunity to knock off work.</p>

<p>"Good," said Floyd; "you shall have two sticks of
tobacco for this, and I will give the same to any one
who finds another like it."</p>

<p>He put it in the box, trying to assume as careless a
manner as possible, and then turned to the work of the
day, ordering at the same time the idlers to get back
to the lagoon.</p>

<p>When the day's work was over, Sru demanded his
tobacco.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Floyd. "I will fetch it over in
the morning when I come."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>But Sru, who was very much of a child, despite his
size and strength, was not to be put off till the morrow.
He wanted his reward at once, and Floyd, irritated,
yet amused at his persistency, ordered him to get into
the dinghy and accompany him across the lagoon to
the camping place.</p>

<p>Here he left him by the boat, while he went off to
the cache for the tobacco.</p>

<p>He had to remove the tarpaulin to get at the case
where it was; having finished this business, he turned
to come back and, doing so, caught a glimpse of Sru.</p>

<p>Sru had left the boat and followed him unnoticed.
He had been watching him through the trees, and must
have seen the cache and its contents, the piles of boxes
and bales of stuff, all half-glimpsed or hinted of under
the tarpaulin.</p>

<p>A chill went to Floyd's heart. He remembered
Schumer's words and his warning against letting any
of the labor men land just here. Schumer had been
so strict that even the Kanaka crew of the <i>Southern
Cross</i>, who had helped to build the house, were never
allowed to go beyond a certain point. And now Sru
had seen everything.</p>

<p>The man was walking back to the lagoon edge when
Floyd overtook him with the tobacco, and Floyd, furious
though he was, could say nothing. Sru had broken
no orders in following him, and to show any anger now
would be the worst policy in the world.</p>

<p>He got into the dinghy, rowed over to the fishing
camp, landed Sru, and returned. It seemed to Floyd
that the capture of a big pearl always brought trouble.
The finding of the pink pearl had been followed by the
going off of Isbel, and now this had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>He lit the fire for supper, and then set to prepare
the meal. When it was over, he sat smoking and
watching the starlight on the water of the lagoon.
Dark ripples were flowing up from the incoming tide,
round points of light showed here and there, the result
of eddies or the splash of jumping fish; away,
seemingly miles away, the camp fires of the pearl fishers
showed spark-like in the blue gloom of night.</p>

<p>The camp fires fascinated Floyd. Isbel was over
there, and over there, also, was Sru. Sru, with his
yellow-tinged eyes, the scars of old battles on his body,
night in his heart, and the knowledge of the cache in
his head.</p>

<p>What a fool he had been to disregard Schumer's
advice; the wise Schumer, who foresaw everything,
had even seen his&mdash;Floyd's&mdash;stupidity.</p>

<p>Well, there was no use in complaining; the thing
now was to make preparation for whatever might happen.
The house door was strong and the walls, without
being loopholed, had convenient spaces&mdash;"ventilation
holes" Schumer had called them&mdash;through which
a rifle might be fired.</p>

<p>He rose up and, going to the house, lit the lamp and
began to overhaul the arms and ammunition. This
done, he retired to bed with a loaded rifle by his side.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE TROUBLE WITH SRU</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">When</span> he came to the fishing ground next morning,
he kept a keen lookout for any alteration
in Sru.</p>

<p>Sru, however, seemed just the same, and the hands
were working as usual. Timau, wholly recovered now,
was working with them, but there was no sign of Isbel.</p>

<p>He asked Sru where she was, and Sru cast his yellow-whited
eyes about as if in search of her. He
opined she might be somewhere in the grove that lay to
the right of the camping place, and indicated the place
with his hand. But as Sru spoke with seeming indifference,
Floyd noticed an expansion of his nostrils and
a new light in his eye. It was as though something
had suddenly irritated him.</p>

<p>That something could only be Isbel.</p>

<p>Floyd thought little of the matter. He knew Isbel's
ways, and could easily imagine that her strange nature
might give cause for friction between herself and her
own people. He set to work and put the thought of
her out of his mind&mdash;or fancied that he had done so.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, she was never quite absent from
his mind, and he had reached the stage now of anger
with the Kanakas that she should be of their blood and
living among them as one of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>The strange psychological fact presented itself that
though Isbel was a Kanaka, he was beginning to feel
toward Kanakas some of that contempt, amounting to
dislike, so evident in Schumer. That she who was so
different to these people around him should be of the
same blood was, so to speak, an insult against her.</p>

<p>Sru's savagery and scars, Timau's ugliness&mdash;for
Timau was a most unbeautiful type, though, withal,
having a certain honestness in his plainness, the
monkey tricks of the others, and their general childishness
and fatuity, all these things were a reflection on Isbel.</p>

<p>And she chose to live among them! She had discarded
him for them. It only wanted that to complete
his feelings on the matter.</p>

<p>Before he returned to the camping place that night
he caught a glimpse of her. She was down by the
lagoon edge, filling a bowl with sea water, and when
he spoke to her she replied to him as usual, yet her
manner was different. She seemed upset about something.
He might have fancied that she was sulking,
had he not known her so well by unconscious study of
all her moods and expressions. This was not ill temper&mdash;as
a matter of fact in all his experience she had
never shown ill temper&mdash;but something else. She was
unhappy. Something had occurred to disturb her or
to frighten her. She seemed cowed, and as she went
off with the full bowl, he was on the point of running
after her to seek an explanation.</p>

<p>But he checked himself in time. He knew quite
well it would be useless, and he dreaded to give her any
cause of offense. Sru most likely had spoken harshly
to her, or she had fallen out with some other member
of the tribe. It was not for him to interfere in the do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>mestic
affairs of this strange company, and now for
the first time fully he recognized the veil of difference
that separated him from this race, alien to him as the
people of some other star.</p>

<p>He got into the dinghy and returned to the house.
It was the evening of the new moon, and even as he
rowed across the lagoon she showed in the blue east
like a reaper's sickle held up for the sun to look at
before his setting.</p>

<p>Never had Floyd felt lonelier than this evening.
Isbel seemed suddenly to have pushed still farther
away from him, and the lonely beauty of the island
under the sunset, and the sickle moon, seemed part of
the new loneliness that had fallen upon his life.</p>

<p>Halfway across the lagoon he stopped rowing and
put his hand to the pocket in which he carried the pearl
box. He had left it behind on a ledge of coral by the
working place. It contained the day's take, two small
pearls of little value; still, it must be recovered.</p>

<p>He turned the boat and rowed back. The hands had
all dispersed along the reef armed with fish spears, the
tide was falling, and there were often big fish to be got
in the rock pools at low tide. Not a soul was in sight,
and, having found the box lying just where he had left
it on the ledge of coral, he turned back toward the
boat. He had nearly reached it when a cry from the
grove which lay to the left of the camping place made
him start.</p>

<p>It was Isbel's voice. In a moment he was away
among the trees, and there he found Sru, Sru
struggling with Isbel.</p>

<p>The thing seemed absurd, absurd as the idea of a
child struggling with a tiger, and yet she was holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
him off, with no breath now to cry out, one hand
twisted in his long hair, and the other striking at his
face.</p>

<p>Next moment Floyd had Sru by the throat, half
strangling him with a powerful grip; then, releasing
him, he struck out.</p>

<p>The blow landed right on the point of the chin, and
Sru, felled like an ox under the poleax, crashed into
an hibiscus bush and lay without kick or movement as
if he were dead. Floyd turned to Isbel. She had
fallen and half risen, supporting herself with one hand
on the ground. She seemed dazed, like a person who
had received a violent blow.</p>

<p>He bent down, picked her up, and, holding her in
his arms, carried her down to the boat. He did not
worry about Sru; his one thought was to get Isbel to
a place of safety. If Sru were dead, there would be no
more trouble over the matter. If, on the contrary, he
was only suffering from the effects of a knock-out blow,
he would certainly seek vengeance when he recovered.
When he placed Isbel in the boat, he found that she
had lost consciousness.</p>

<p>The sun had not set; it was at the moment of conflict
between the starlight and the last rays of sunset, the
pale sickle of the moon had grown to a brilliant orange
gold, and the light was strong enough to brighten the
lagoon water.</p>

<p>Arrived at the beach, he stepped out, and, lifting
Isbel in his arms, carried her up to the house. She was
no longer unconscious, and, as he carried her, he felt
her arm clasped round his neck. It was as though she
were accepting his protection and thanking him at the
same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>Arrived at the house, he placed her on the bunk
mattress upon which he always slept, lit the lamp, and knelt
down beside her. "You'll stay here now, Isbel," said
he; "you will not run away from me any more, will
you? I've been pretty lonely without you, but I did
not mind so long as I thought you were happy with
your own people. You see how they have treated
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She raised herself on her elbow and looked into his
face, the lamplight struck her hair and forehead, while
he saw nothing for the moment, and knew of nothing,
but the brown depths of her eyes, so close to him, so
mysterious, so luminous&mdash;yet so dark.</p>

<p>"I will stay," said she. "I did not know you before.
I know you now."</p>

<p>He took her hand and she let him hold it for a
moment. It was the first time that hand had been in his,
a hand firm, yet soft, subtle, yet capable, warm as life
itself. Then he released it and rose up. There was
grim business to be attended to, and as he fetched the
two rifles and their ammunition from the adjoining
room, the feeling came to him that up to this he had
never really lived, but had only existed as a spectator
of life. Here was life raw and real, the battle for
existence and love and everything worth having; the
supreme moment which many of us never know.</p>

<p>He placed the rifles on the table and the
ammunition beside them, and then went back and fetched the
revolvers. When he returned, he found that Isbel had
left the mattress and was standing by the table, with
one hand resting on it, and her eyes fixed on him.</p>

<p>"These are for Sru if he comes with any of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
fellows behind him," said Floyd. "It's as well to be
prepared."</p>

<p>"Schumer showed me how," said she, "before you
came here&mdash;long before. Look&mdash;&mdash;" She opened
the breech of one of the Winchesters, extracted the
cartridges, and put them back. "Then you fire&mdash;so."
She put the rifle to her shoulder and took aim at some
imaginary object, then, lowering it, she turned to him,
and for the first time she smiled.</p>

<p>Her eyes lit with a new light, her little teeth shone,
it was as though something bright and fierce, some
unknown spirit, dwelling in her nature, had suddenly
peeped out. He recalled the day when they had
smashed the bottles on the reef, and she had assisted,
laughing at the destruction. She had not smiled, she
had laughed, little short laughs sharp as the thrusts of
a stabbing spear.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Floyd, "you know how to use a gun.
Well, that's all the better. If they come to make any
trouble, we will be able to give them something they
won't like, you and I."</p>

<p>"You and I," said Isbel, with the same smile. Then,
suddenly, she pressed her little white teeth on her
under lip.</p>

<p>She placed the rifle back on the table, and, turning,
left the house by the open door.</p>

<p>Floyd looked after her, wondering what had
happened now. He finished the examination of the rifles
and revolvers, and then, leaving them upon the table,
came outside.</p>

<p>Isbel was lighting the fire to prepare supper for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>BEFORE THE ATTACK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">That</span> night he made her sleep in the house, while
he took his place outside. He arranged to call
her when half the night was over, so that she might
keep watch while he slept, and as he sat with his back
to the house wall, and a loaded rifle by his side, he
tried to forecast the possibility of an attack and the
upshot, should it occur.</p>

<p>The fact that Sru had seen the cache weighed with
him as much as the occurrence of that evening. The
two facts combined made the position very, very
threatening. The labor men had no arms and ammunition,
but they were thirty in number; they had no boat, but
they had the raft, and though the reef was almost
impassable, Isbel had got along it that night of her flight,
and what she had done, these fellows could doubtless
accomplish also.</p>

<p>He could see the sparks of the camp fires away
across the lagoon, but though the wind was blowing
from over there, it brought no sound on it. Usually
one could catch stray snatches of song from across the
water, or the fellows shouting as they speared fish in
the rock pools by torchlight.</p>

<p>To-night the silence seemed ominous, and the light
of the camp fires like threatening eyes. Now and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
would come the splash of a fish, and now and again
the wind breezing up for a moment would set the
foliage moving in the grove, the breadfruit leaves
clapping like great green hands, and the palm fronds
rustling and cheeping.</p>

<p>The surf on the outer reef was low of sound to-night,
yet, occasionally, over to the west, where the full
trend of the swell was meeting the coral, it would
speak louder and become angry like the sound of a
train at full speed.</p>

<p>Even the stars had taken on the aspect of attention;
they seemed watching and waiting to see something
that would surely occur.</p>

<p>Floyd had to get up and pace the sands to break the
spell. Then, after a while, he sat down again. The
fires over at the fishing camp had died out, the wind
had fallen to the merest breath, and the surf on the
western reef no longer snarled.</p>

<p>Danger seemed to have drawn away from the island,
leaving behind her the profoundest peace. Floyd,
whose eyes were longing to close despite all his efforts
to keep awake, felt a touch on his shoulder. It was
Isbel come to relieve guard. When he came out next
morning, the sun was up, and Isbel had lit the fire and
was preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>They sat down to the meal together, and, when it
was over, Floyd declared his intention of going, as
usual, to the fishery.</p>

<p>"We must keep the work going, at all costs," said
he. "If I did not, they would think I was afraid, and
then they would be sure to attack us. Besides, there
may be nothing to fear. Sru is the only one I care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
about, the others are pretty harmless, with no one to
lead them, and Sru may be knocked out. He looked
pretty dead when I left him."</p>

<p>Isbel shook her head.</p>

<p>"One blow would not kill Sru," said she. "Too
strong. If you go, I go with you."</p>

<p>"You," said Floyd. "And suppose&mdash;suppose they
attack us?"</p>

<p>"Suppose you go alone and get killed," said Isbel,
"what become of me here alone? No, I go if you go.
I can shoot. I stay in the boat to keep it safe, whiles
you go to the fishing. If they come to take the boat, I
kill them. If they strike at you, I kill them. You don't
know me. I know myself. I have no fear at all."</p>

<p>"I believe you," said he. "Yes, we will go together;
you are worth half a dozen men&mdash;&mdash;Isbel,
why did you run away from me that time?"</p>

<p>Isbel looked down.</p>

<p>"I went to find my own people," said she at last.
"I was afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid of me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Isbel; "you and Schumer, and
being alone with you made me afraid."</p>

<p>"And you are not afraid any longer?"</p>

<p>"With you I am not any more afraid," said Isbel,
speaking with difficulty, and drawing a little pattern on
the sand with her finger tip. Then, looking up: "Not
even with Schumer, if you were there."</p>

<p>Floyd was about to take her hand, but he restrained
himself.</p>

<p>"That is good," said he. "You need never have
been afraid of me. I care for you too much to let any
one hurt you, and that morning when I came out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
house and found you gone, when I searched in the
grove and along the reef and could not see you and
thought you might be drowned and that I would never
see you again, the world seemed no use any longer."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet as if to check his words, and
walked off to the house, leaving Isbel still seated on the
sand, and still drawing the pattern with her finger.</p>

<p>He returned with one of the Winchester rifles under
his arm, a revolver in his hand, and one in his pocket.</p>

<p>Isbel rose, and, going down to the lagoon edge, they
pushed the dinghy off, got in, and started for the
fishing camp. As they drew near they saw that the fishing
was going on apparently as usual, and the first person
to greet them on the beach was Sru.</p>

<p>There were all the elements for a strained situation,
but Sru showed no sign of the incident of the day
before, and when Floyd stepped out on the sand, nodded
his head as usual, and grumbled something in his throat
that seemed intended for a welcome. But his eye lit
on the Winchester Isbel propped against the seat of the
dinghy, and it doubtless took in, also, the revolver butt
sticking from Floyd's coat pocket.</p>

<p>The seeming indifference of Sru to what had
happened struck Floyd as almost uncanny; then, as they
set to work, he let the matter drop from his mind. If
it satisfied Sru to take a thrashing and say nothing, it
satisfied Floyd's policy to let the matter drop. The
man had been punished for his misdeed, and the
incident was closed, for the present at least.</p>

<p>Now Schumer would undoubtedly have tried the
man and shot him offhand, not only for the attack on
Isbel, but to safeguard the little colony. Floyd, though
just as courageous as Schumer at a pinch, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
more so, was incapable of acting the part of
executioner. He could not kill a man in cold blood.</p>

<p>So he worked side by side with the yellow-eyed one,
and as the labor went on he forgot more and more the
danger of the situation, but he might have noticed, had
he turned, that Isbel, who had taken her seat on the
sand by the boat, never left her position for a moment,
and that position enabled her, if need arose, to stretch
out her arm and seize the Winchester that was propped
against the seat of the dinghy.</p>

<p>Neither would she have anything to say to the
fellows who were diving. The raft came several times
ashore to discharge shell, and some of the hands drew
close to her, but she told them to clear off.</p>

<p>Floyd heard her voice once or twice hard and sharp,
a quite new voice for her. He could not tell what she
said, but he noticed that none of the fellows
approached her.</p>

<p>Some of them, as far as he could judge, seemed
deriding her just as schoolboys joke at one of their
number who has made himself unpopular, but they kept
their distance.</p>

<p>At the dinner hour shortly before noon, the whole
crowd of the labor men, joined by Sru, drew off to a
spot close to the tents, and, squatting in a ring, set to
on their food.</p>

<p>Work was always knocked off in the middle of the
day, Floyd returning to the house for a siesta. He
came now toward Isbel, intending to help her to push
the dinghy off, but instead of rising, she made him sit
down beside her.</p>

<p>"See them," said she. "They sit all together and
like that." She made a ring on the sand with her fin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>ger.
"I go and hear what they say if you wait. It is
no good when they sit like that all together and talk
while they eat&mdash;&mdash;Wait!"</p>

<p>She rose up and walked along the beach edge,
picking up shells. Then she drew close to the grove and
vanished into it. Some of the tents were situated close
up to the grove, and the hands were seated eating and
talking close to the tent. They looked after Isbel as
she was walking along the beach edge. When she
disappeared, they seemed to forget her, and went on with
their palaver. Floyd waited. Five minutes later he
saw the form of the girl away out from among the
trees. She walked right down to the edge of the
lagoon, and then came along toward Floyd, still picking
up an occasional shell.</p>

<p>When she reached him she showed him the shells.</p>

<p>"No good," said she. "But look at them so they
may see."</p>

<p>Floyd handled the shells and pretended to admire
them; then she placed them in the dinghy and they
pushed her off.</p>

<p>It was not till they reached the middle of the lagoon
that she told of what she had done, and what she had
heard.</p>

<p>She had crept through the grove to the back of one
of the tents, and listened to the chatter that had come
clearly heard on the slight wind that was blowing
toward the grove.</p>

<p>Something was afoot, and whatever they were going
to do was to be done that night. From what Isbel
gathered, an attack was to be made on them, and the
attackers would cross the lagoon on the raft.</p>

<p>Floyd, who was rowing, pulled in his sculls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>"The raft," said he. "I never thought of that.
They can get twenty chaps on to it. We must stop
this. It is going to be war anyhow, so we may as well
strike first."</p>

<p>He told Isbel the fear that had suddenly occurred
to him, and she laughed. Then taking to the sculls
again, he rowed on as hard as he could, till they reached
their destination.</p>

<p>Leaving Isbel to look after the dinghy, he ran up to
the house and came back with a hammer, a big nail, and
a coil of rope. Then they pushed off again, making for
the fishing camp. The raft, when not in use, was
moored by a rope to a spur of coral jutting out from
the sand.</p>

<p>As they approached, they could see the labor men
still seated at their pow-wow. Heads were turned as
the dinghy drew near to the raft, but not a man moved
till Isbel, with a rifle in one hand and a knife in the
other, cut the mooring rope.</p>

<p>Then a yell rose up, and the whole crowd, rising like
one man, came racing down to the water's edge, picking
up stones as they ran, while some of them, turning,
made off for the fish spears in the tents.</p>

<p>While Isbel had been cutting the rope, Floyd, with
three blows of the hammer, had driven the big nail into
one of the logs, tied the rope to it, tied the other end
of the rope to the rings in the stern of the dinghy, and
was now sculling for his life. The heavy raft moved
slowly, and the crowd on shore, held up for a moment
by the water, were just taking to it when Isbel's rifle
rang out, and the foremost of them, hit through the
shoulder, sat down with a yell on the sand. The rush
was broken for a moment, and Floyd, as he tugged at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the sculls, saw a sight that would have made him laugh,
had he been watching from a place of safety.</p>

<p>The balked ones literally danced on the sands. Fury
drove them, but fright held them, and the dance was
the result till the fellows with the fish spears made
their appearance, racing down from the tents.</p>

<p>Floyd instantly put the dinghy alongside the raft,
and, springing on to it, took the rifle from the girl,
while she, getting into the dinghy, took the sculls and
went on with the towing.</p>

<p>Floyd dropped the first spearman twenty paces from
the water's edge, and he fell on his belly, while the
spear slithered along the beach.</p>

<p>The second spearman, struck fair in the forehead,
flung out his arms and fell on his back. The spear,
striking the sand with its butt, stood upright and
quivering, the point, still dark with fish blood, impotent
and pointing to the sky.</p>

<p>It was enough for the others. They broke and ran,
and, as they ran, Floyd fired on them, catching one
fellow through the leg and knocking a tuft of hair off
another's head.</p>

<p>In thirty seconds the beach was clear.</p>

<p>Floyd through it all had acted almost automatically
and as if firing at a target. The whole business seemed
strangely impersonal and unreal. That he should be
standing there, killing men like flies, seemed part of
the everyday business of life, and yet, at the back of
his mind, something was crying out against it all, a
voice small as though it had traveled from a thousand
miles away, and without substance or sound or weight
in effect on his mind.</p>

<p>He stood with the taste of the cartridge smoke in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
his mouth, staring at the beach, while from behind him
he could hear the sound of the sculls in the rowlocks
as Isbel strained at the oars.</p>

<p>They were now well out from the shore, and he took
his place in the boat at the sculls, while Isbel got on
the raft.</p>

<p>The beach they were leaving was all trodden up,
and the bodies of the two dead men lay, one huddled
up as though he were asleep, the other spread-eagled
and looking like a brown starfish, the spear he had
been carrying so valiantly standing beside him, barb
pointing to the sky.</p>

<p>The light wind was blowing the dry sand in little
eddies, and under the blazing sunlight the salt white
beach and the emerald shallows of the lagoon made a
dazzling picture. Nothing could seem farther
removed from death or the thought of death than this
brilliant scene, where the slain were lying unburied and
Death himself was watching from the grove of trees
that formed its background.</p>

<p>Isbel stood on the raft as he towed it, her hand
shading her eyes, her gaze fixed on the shore.</p>

<p>Floyd, recalling her horror of the hanging and the
effect it produced upon her, could not help wondering
at her attitude now, till he remembered the difference
between the cold-blooded execution of a man and the
killing of a man in self-defense.</p>

<p>When they had reached the middle of the lagoon,
she turned from gazing at the shore and sat down on
the raft. They did not speak to one another till the
dinghy was landed and the raft moored by a long rope
which they tied to one of the seats of the quarter boat,
which was lying high and dry on the sand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>"Well," said Floyd, when this was finished, "we are
in for it now, Isbel, you and I. These fellows won't
sit down and do nothing, or, if they do, I am greatly
mistaken."</p>

<p>"No," said Isbel, "they will try to kill us." She said
it quite simply, as though she were talking of some
matter of little moment.</p>

<p>"And we'll try to stop them," said Floyd, with a
laugh. It is the sign mark of the Anglo-Saxon and
Celts and all breeds that spring from their mixture,
that they go laughing into battle, die jesting, and carve
their enemies with epigrams as well as swords; battle
brings a levity of spirit that in its turn brings victory,
and Floyd, now that war was declared, moved lightly
and felt a liveliness at heart such as he had not
experienced since boyhood.</p>

<p>He had destroyed the enemy's fleet, but he had not
destroyed their land forces, and worse than all, he had
not put their general out of action.</p>

<p>Sru was still alive, and he was more dangerous than
all the others.</p>

<p>When the firing had begun, Sru had flung himself
flat on his stomach on the sand, and from that position
had yelled his orders. It was evident that he was the
directing spirit of the whole business, and it was nearly
certain that he would not take defeat lying down.</p>

<p>The weak position of the house as a defensive
stronghold lay in its proximity to the grove and the
fact that it did not command the approach to this bit
of the island by way of the reef. The back of the
building was close up to the trees, and, though there
were chinks that made good loopholes for firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
through, the trees, and especially their shadow by
night, gave good cover for an attacking party.</p>

<p>Then there was the prospect of a siege. Floyd,
taking his seat on the sand in the shade of the trees, called
to Isbel to sit down beside him.</p>

<p>Then they held a council of war.</p>

<p>"How many fish spears have those fellows got,
Isbel?" asked he.</p>

<p>"Many," replied Isbel. "They were making them
a long time ago&mdash;too many for fishing."</p>

<p>"You mean they were made for the purpose of
attacking us&mdash;I mean, of attacking me, for you were
with them then?"</p>

<p>Isbel nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I did not know. I thought then it was for
the fishing. Now I know better. It was Sru who told
them to make more spears, and they would all get
together and talk. I had no feeling at all that it was
wrong, else I would have listened. But now I see
it all."</p>

<p>This cast even a darker light on Sru. He must have
been plotting all along and from the first. Plotting
to seize Isbel for himself, kill the only white man on
the place, and seize all the valuables he could find.
That was doubtless his plan of campaign. As to the
far future, and how he was to escape from the island
and from punishment, he was unlikely to have made
any plan. The savage view is a short view, and is
mainly occupied by immediate desires and the means
of gratifying them. It is only the trained intelligence
that forecasts and lays plans only to be carried out in
the far future.</p>

<p>Sru wanted Isbel, and tobacco more than he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
use, knives for which he had no use, firearms to glut
his desire for lethal weapons, printed cotton, and the
satisfaction of the lust to kill. He most likely
promised himself Floyd served up roasted in plantain leaves,
for he belonged to the man-eating order of Solomanders.
So in his dark mind he had constructed a scheme
for getting these things and satisfying these desires,
and had carried out his scheme while working in amity
with the man he intended to destroy.</p>

<p>His military genius had not proved itself on a par
with his genius for villainy, but he had the numbers,
while Floyd only had the rifles, for rifles, even though
they be Winchesters, firing five shots apiece, are of
limited use without men behind them.</p>

<p>From the edge of the grove bordering the rough
coral of the reef a good lookout could be kept toward
the fishing ground. From here the lagoon, exclusive
of the segment, including the reef opening, could be
watched.</p>

<p>One could see the fishing camp and the whole of the
roof leading from it. Standing here, one could
command with a rifle all that strip of rough and broken
coral that made a natural defense, and along which an
attacking force must come, if it wished to reach the
house by land.</p>

<p>Floyd determined that this was the point where
watch must be kept by night. The coral, though rough
and sharp here and there as knives, was not impassable
to a determined foe. Isbel had got along it that time
she ran away, and these fellows, with foot soles like
leather and nerves insensitive to cuts and falls, could
do what she had done.</p>

<p>He posted Isbel now to keep watch, while, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
back to the house, he made preparations for a possible
siege.</p>

<p>Taking the tarpaulin from the cache, he made a collection
of all the tinned food that came first to hand.
There were two bags of ship's bread still left, and
these, with the tins of bully beef, potatoes, and so
forth, he carried to the house. Then he filled two of
the water beakers at the well and placed them in the
main room of the building.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the albini rifles. These, with
their ammunition, were stored separately, and the conveyance
of them would have meant a considerable
amount of labor and time. He took only the ammunition
which was made up in four large parcels. These
he carted down to the dinghy, rowed her out into five
fathom of water, and dumped the parcels in the lagoon.</p>

<p>The bottom of the lagoon where he dumped them
was pretty rough coral, so they would not be shifted
much by the tide, and could be fished up later on.</p>

<p>Having completed all these preparations, he rejoined
Isbel at the lookout post.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon now, and neither of
them had eaten anything since morning, so he sent Isbel
to the house to get some food, and, taking his seat
with his back to a tree, waited her return.</p>

<p>Alone like this, he sat with his eyes fixed on the
enemy's country, on the lookout for any sign of movement
on their part. He had brought the telescope with
him, and used it now and then without effect. Through
it he could see the fishing beach and the bodies still lying
upon it, the spear, sticking upright from the sand,
the trodden-up sand, and the deserted tents. That was
all. There was no sign of the enemy, who were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
doubt hiding in the grove behind the tents, or on the
reef beyond the grove.</p>

<p>He argued that they must have been considerably
scared to have effaced themselves in this fashion, yet
he knew enough of savages to prevent him from building
too much on moral effect. They might be scared
now, but the effect would wear off, and the desire for
revenge and blood and loot reassert itself. Even now,
though they were in hiding, they were doubtless holding
a powwow, with Sru as chairman.</p>

<p>The position was bad. The pearl fishing had ceased,
the island was in a state of war, there could be no
peace or parleying with the enemy simply because there
could be no trust placed in them while Sru was alive
and active. At best, they could hold their own only
by a continuous watch and defensive until Schumer returned.
But Schumer might be delayed; he might
never come back, the <i>Southern Cross</i> might even now
be lying at the bottom of the Pacific, or hove up on
some reef a thousand miles away from the Island of
Pearls. As this thought came to him, he cast his eyes
across the great space of sea visible on the ocean side
of the reef. The sea, in the late afternoon light, lay
calm but for the gentle swell that heaved it shoreward,
but he knew well the treachery of that sea, of all seas
the most fair&mdash;and faithless.</p>

<p>He was aroused from his thoughts by Isbel, who had
returned, bringing him some food. She had also
brought with her a rifle and some more ammunition.
As she stood with the gun in her hand, gazing over
toward the fishing camp, Floyd watched her, wondering
at the change in her and the difference between
this figure and the Isbel he had known at first&mdash;the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
he had seen that day of his first landing on the island.</p>

<p>Even during the last couple of days she had changed.
Nothing makes for the development of the best and
the worst in us like war. The struggle for existence,
brought to a flaming point, is the true fire assay for
character. Not only does the human soul develop in
this ordeal, but the human being ages. Isbel, since the
morning of the day before, seemed a year older, and
Floyd's boyish character had taken on a sternness and
received a solidification that ten years of ordinary life
might not have effected.</p>

<p>She sat down beside him, and they ate the food she
had brought, talking little, and each ever on the watch
for any movement of the enemy. There was nothing.
Nothing but the gulls flying in the blue, and the waves
breaking on the coral and the wind moving the foliage
of the distant trees.</p>

<p>The island might have been deserted but for their
presence and those brown spots lying on the sand of
the distant beach.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE GREAT FIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">No</span> fires were lit on the fishing beach that evening,
nor did the wind from across the lagoon bring
any sound of singing from the fishermen.</p>

<p>Floyd remained at the lookout post while Isbel, returning
to the house, put everything in order and gave
a last touch to the defenses and a last look around.
Then she returned and took her place beside him.</p>

<p>The moon, stronger to-night, yellow and brilliant,
hung in the apple-green dusk of the eastern sky. It
looked exactly like the quarter of a crystallized orange;
then, as the sky steadily and swiftly darkened, it lost
its yellow tinge and became a sickle of frosted silver.</p>

<p>The light was powerful enough to sparkle up the
whole lagoon and show the reef like a curving gray
road set on either side with the lagoon water and the
foam of the sea.</p>

<p>The fishing beach showed clearly, and the grove,
even the tents could be made out as gray flecks against
the darkness of the trees, but sign of life there was
none.</p>

<p>"I would like it better if we could see more of them,"
said Floyd. "They are a lot too quiet."</p>

<p>"They will come to-night, I think," said Isbel.
"They are hiding now and talking. Sru will lead
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Floyd laughed. "He led them finely on the beach
over there this afternoon," said he, "lying on his stomach
all the time!"</p>

<p>"That is why I fear him," said Isbel. "He is very
clever; the others are not clever, but they are good to
fight. Sru is the head; they are the hands. Sru is a
devil."</p>

<p>"You did not know what Sru was that time you left
me and went back to them," said he.</p>

<p>"No," replied Isbel; "I thought he was good then.
He said to me: 'Why not come back to your own
people?' The words he said to me grew in my mind
like seeds in the ground. I did not know you then. I
thought you were the same as Schumer."</p>

<p>"You know me now."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Isbel, "I know you now."</p>

<p>He could see her profile against the stars and the line
of her delicately shaped head. She was sitting with
her hands about her knees, in just the same position
as on the day when, drawing near the beach, Schumer
had stood to receive him, and Isbel had sat watching,
seemingly indifferent, gazing at him with those eyes
whose gaze held so much of the unknown.</p>

<p>She wore a flower in her hair that day, and she wore
a flower in her hair to-night, a perfumed blossom
plucked as she was passing through the grove. The
scent of it came to him with a trace of the hot, gorse-like
perfume of her hair, and for a moment he forgot
Sru, the island, the fight on the beach, and the whole
desperate position. For a moment only. As they sat
beneath the stars, watching the moonlight grow
stronger upon the lagoon water and the reef, suddenly
from away out there came a cry like the sudden clam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>oring
of sea fowl. A sound fierce and sharp and with
the ring of triumph in it. The invisibility of the enemy
and the absolute silence they had maintained up till
now lent the sound a weird significance.</p>

<p>"They are starting," said Floyd.</p>

<p>Isbel nodded. She said nothing; she was listening.
Then she said: "They will have been talking, all sitting
round as they were to-day. Sru will have been
making plans to come here and kill us. Then when all
their minds went together like men with spears they
shouted like that and jumped to their feet and started."</p>

<p>She spoke like a person who was watching it all in
some magic glass, slowly and in a dreamy manner and
with a detachment as though what she were viewing
had nothing to do with them.</p>

<p>"They'll start more before I have done with them,"
said Floyd viciously.</p>

<p>The events of the day, the tension of waiting, and
that shout, cruel as a barbed spear coming out of the
night, had raised the fierce fighting spirit of his race,
a spirit all the more potent and terrible from the
underlying sobriety that tempers its fierceness and
levity.</p>

<p>"It's funny to think we may be knocked out before
the sun rises again," said he. "What do you think
happens to a man when he's dead, Isbel?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It is, I think, all the same as before
he is born. He doesn't know."</p>

<p>"That's what I have often thought myself," said
he. "Look! What is that?"</p>

<p>Away toward the far end of the reef they saw moving
points upon the coral. Huge insects seemed crawl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>ing
here and there, aimlessly at first, and now approaching
nearer.</p>

<p>"They are coming," said Floyd, seizing a rifle.
"They are spreading themselves out, and that confounded
coral gives them good sheltering places. We
must stop them if possible."</p>

<p>He stood up, and, putting the rifle to his shoulder,
aimed it at the nearest moving spot and fired. He continued
blazing away till the chambers were empty.
The movement ceased, but almost immediately it recommenced,
and now they could see the brown figures
crouching and crawling, spread out fanwise, taking
cover at every projection, and always advancing closer.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible to fire effectively, owing to
the uncertain light and the fact that at the first flash
every figure fell flat or dodged behind cover.</p>

<p>Between the rough coral and the point where they
stood lay forty yards or so of smooth ground, across
which the final rush would be made.</p>

<p>"It seems we can't stop them," said Floyd as he
emptied the contents of the second rifle, while the girl
reloaded, "and once they get near the edge of that
smooth bit they'll rush us. Get everything together
when I give the word and make back for the house.
Ah, I had one then!"</p>

<p>A shriek following the shot he had just fired told of
a hit, but it did not stop the advance. On the contrary,
the wretches had now reached the psychological point,
the point where instinct told them collectively that a
rush must surely succeed, and where optimism told
them individually that it was the next man who would
be hit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>They left cover boldly, and, heedless of the rough
coral, of the pitfalls and sharp edges, leaped to the
attack like bounding kangaroos.</p>

<p>Floyd bagged two of them with his two last shots;
then calling to Isbel, who had also been firing, he led
the way through the trees toward the house.</p>

<p>Isbel, with forethought, had lit the lamp in the main
room, and the glow of it shining through the loopholes
in the walls showed them their way. Once inside, they
barred the door, placed the guns on the table, and began
to reload.</p>

<p>They did not speak a word. Coolly and swiftly
they shoved the cartridges in their places, and then,
each with a rifle, stood at attention to the hell of voices
from outside.</p>

<p>Never could Floyd have believed that human beings
were capable of such sounds of ferocity and malevolence.
Only in the long boo-hoo of the storm that
had torn the bones of the <i>Tonga</i> to pieces had he heard
anything like this outburst.</p>

<p>Fists and feet were thundering at the door, spear
points poking through the openings in the walls, but all
that was nothing to the uproar of the voices. The
calling of monkeys and the shrieks of parrots seemed
mixed with the howl of hyenas, and more terrible than
these came an incessant, fierce whistling, harsh as the
whistling of steam.</p>

<p>Floyd was less a philosopher than a man of action,
yet even so, and though he had no time for philosophy
in such a crisis, his mind for a moment was held by one
stupendous fact&mdash;these fiends storming the house were
not devils just let loose from the infernal regions; they
were the "hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>The men he had worked with and overseen, pleasant
and childlike creatures full of fun and laughter,
most of them. It is true that many of them had, when
in repose, that hard, set expression which seems to have
come from ages of watching across the sun blaze on the
sea, but their faces could express good humor, one
might say, fluently, and as they had always been well
treated on the island they had never cause to express
anything else.</p>

<p>When Floyd had seen them first on the day that he
and Schumer had boarded the <i>Southern Cross</i> they
had struck him as a very hard lot, and a good deal of
that expression had come from the shell nose rings
and the slit ear lobes distinguishing most of them; as
he got to know them better that impression became less
vivid. Yet it had been the right one. The shell nose
rings and split ear lobes were surely "features" inasmuch
as they spoke of ages and ages of savagery,
blood, and darkness.</p>

<p>Yet the second impression had been right in its way.
Despite all their savagery these people were human,
had in them a certain bonhomie and sense of humor,
and possessed many of those traits which we associate
with the word "gentleman." The latter curious fact
had been impressed on Floyd several times in his dealings
with them. Sru, for instance, the worst of the
lot, though he had probably dined off his enemy in his
time, and though he had planned and plotted murder,
would not have hurt your feelings for the world by
word or gesture. Floyd, having reloaded, disregarding
the door toward which the main attack seemed
directed, chose loopholes near the ones through which
the spear points were being thrust, and fired with <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>effete,
to judge by the sounds that followed the shots.
Isbel, crawling and creeping close to the walls, seized
on the spear shafts, and, using all her weight, broke
them off.</p>

<p>She managed to break three like this, and then returned
to the loading. Dark, cool, swift, and absolutely
fearless, she seemed in these mad minutes the
very spirit of destruction. They had ammunition in
abundance, and when she was not engaged in reloading
for Floyd she used one of the revolvers herself. The
smoke of the firing blown back through the loopholes
made a haze round the steadily burning lamp, near
which, from the ceiling, a big spider was swinging
from his thread, laying his nets utterly undisturbed by
the sounds and fumes of the fight.</p>

<p>Then gradually the attack died down. The gentry
outside had exhausted themselves mostly by yelling;
they had done no damage and had received several
injuries. Had they possessed a single firearm they
might have made the position untenable, but they had
nothing, and they had evidently come to recognize the
fact that poking spears through loopholes was useless
work, besides being dangerous.</p>

<p>Floyd wiped his brow with his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>"The fools have never thought of forcing the door,"
said he; "they might have done it with that crowbar.
You remember the piece of iron I used to break open
the big clamshell. They never thought of that. They
came with spears only, and there is nothing over on
this side they can use to force the door with. Let's
hope they won't remember about it."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said Isbel.</p>

<p>Sounds were coming from the grove at the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the house, sounds more of a jubilant than a warlike
nature.</p>

<p>Floyd knitted his brow; then his face cleared.</p>

<p>"I know what it is," said he. "They have got at
the cache."</p>

<p>The fragment of moon low down in the west lit the
beach, and very soon Floyd's suspicion was justified.
Peeping through the loopholes of the front wall, they
saw the whole band of the enemy debouching on the
sands away to the left, and every man laden with loot.</p>

<p>Some were carrying bolts of cloth, and others cases
of provisions and boxes of tobacco.</p>

<p>They thought themselves beyond rifle range, and,
like children, they wanted to examine their treasures.
Floyd, assured that none of them had remained behind,
opened the door, and, rifle in hand, stood watching
them. Then he opened fire, and they scattered,
leaving their treasures on the sand. Some ran along
the lagoon edge, toward the reef opening; one dashed
right into the water and swam in the same direction,
while the main body made back for the shelter of the
grove.</p>

<p>Not one of them was hit as far as he could see, and
the men who had made toward the reef opening would
return by the seaward side of the reef.</p>

<p>"I almost wish I had left them alone," said he. "It
will only make them more vicious. The sight of that
stuff lying there will keep them going. However, it is
too late to bother now."</p>

<p>He turned back to the house and shut the door. He
had been speaking to Isbel, and fancied her to be just
behind him. She was not. She was at the table,
quietly preparing some food. He noticed now for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
first time that the flower was still in her hair. It
looked dark purple in the lamplight. And now for a
moment a strange sensation stole over him, as though
the whole of the business were a fantastic dream, a
sensation of unreality that infected even his own being.
It passed, and, coming to the table where the food was
now lying beside the rifles and ammunition, he drew
one of the chairs up and sat down sideways to the
board.</p>

<p>Isbel remained standing, and as they ate they talked,
and what they said had little to do with the main business
in hand. It was not a thing to be talked about.
The situation was hopeless, if ever a situation was
hopeless, and no plan had yet appeared to either of
them by which their position could be bettered.</p>

<p>Ideas had come to Floyd only to be dismissed as
useless, the idea, for instance, of making a dash from
the house and taking to the dinghy, which they could
easily push off. That would not help them in the least,
since there was no place of safety to which the dinghy
could take them. Their assailants would not expose
themselves to rifle fire by day, and by night they would
attack as they had done before.</p>

<p>The only spot where they could put up a defense
for any time would be the pierhead at the break on the
opposite side of the reef, and there they would be cut
off from all food supplies.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing we have plenty of food here and
water," said Floyd. "We have water enough for a
week and food for a fortnight. I expect those fellows
will get back to the fishing camp to-morrow and leave
us alone."</p>

<p>He said it for the sake of saying something, but Isbel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
shook her head. She knew the men they had to deal
with.</p>

<p>"They will never leave us till we kill them or they
kill us," said she, clearing the things from the table.
"Or," she finished, "till we kill Sru."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Floyd, "he's the center of the whole
business. Well, we will do our best to nail him."</p>

<p>He rose up and went to one of the loopholes by the
door. Peeping through, he could see the trade goods
still lying on the sands, but not a sign of the enemy.</p>

<p>One of the most disturbing things in this fight was
the manner in which the attackers would suddenly
efface themselves, as after the first fight over on the
fishing beach. They had vanished now as though annihilated,
leaving neither outpost nor sign to hint of
what plan they might be brewing.</p>

<p>The moon was very low down over the western reef.
It was close to dawn, and soon the sun would be flooding
the world with light. If another attack was in
preparation it would not be long delayed, yet not a
sound came to indicate an approach to the house.</p>

<p>"All the same they will come," said Isbel, "and they
will come before day."</p>

<p>"You think so?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>Isbel nodded. She had taken a seat on one of the
chairs, and was sitting with her hands clasping her
knees. Floyd, who had taken his seat at the table,
was leaning his arms upon it and following with his
eyes the graining of the wood.</p>

<p>The spider overhead, who had finished making, or
maybe repairing, his net, had just fallen on luck; a
long-legged fly that had been flitting about the rafters
was his prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>The fly, caught by a few strands of the infernal web,
was making a fierce resistance. It was caught by one
of its legs and by the body. The wings were free, and
the buzz of their vibration made Floyd look up.</p>

<p>Then, for something to do, he rose and examined
the thing more closely. Isbel rose, too.</p>

<p>The spider was quite patient about his work, and
horribly scientific in his methods. The buzzing wings
did not disturb him in the least. He ascended to the
rafter which was his base, and then came down again,
fixed a thread to one of his victim's legs, and reascended.
He was binding the legs together, making
everything absolutely secure before the final assault
and the moment when he would bury his fangs in his
prey and suck its blood.</p>

<p>Watching the little tragedy, Floyd and Isbel for a
moment almost forgot their own position. Then
Floyd, with a laugh, raised his finger and broke the
strands of the web, releasing the fly.</p>

<p>"It was in about as bad a position as we are," said
he. "Maybe it's an omen."</p>

<p>Isbel did not know what the word "omen" meant,
nor did she ask, for at that moment, as they stood in
silence watching the released one trying its wings
again, a sound coming from the back of the house made
them turn.</p>

<p>A soft, stealthy sound, as though people were creeping
close to the wall, and now and then the sharp snap
of some stick of the undergrowth trodden upon and
broken.</p>

<p>Floyd, springing to the table, seized a revolver and
began firing through the loophole of the back wall.
He fired six shots at random; then he paused to listen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>The sound continued. The men outside were evidently
crouching at whatever work they were on, and
so were safe and below the level of the loopholes.</p>

<p>"Brutes!" said he. "There is no chance of reaching
them, but what on earth can they be about?"</p>

<p>Isbel, who had been peeping through one of the
chinks near the door, came toward him.</p>

<p>"The day has broken," said she.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>DAYBREAK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Even</span> as she spoke the words, and as though in
answer to the question he had asked, a faint
smell of burning filled the air of the room, and through
one of the chinks, like a little gray snake, a wreath of
smoke coiled upward, clinging to the woodwork.</p>

<p>"So that's what they were doing!" cried Floyd.
"They have fired the house."</p>

<p>Through every chink and crevice a curl of smoke
was licking upward, and now came the sharp, crackling
sound of brushwood burning and the snap and hiss of
sticks blazing alight.</p>

<p>The air of the room was already turned to a gray
haze of smoke, smoke that made the eyes smart, the
smoke of burning hibiscus and poison oak and bay
cedar bush, choking and suffocating fumes, followed
now by flames as the wretches outside flung coconut
shells on the fire, shells that blazed like flare lamps
once ignited.</p>

<p>"The place will burn like a torch," said Floyd,
"once the scantling gets alight. Listen! What's that
above? They have got on the roof; they are lighting
it. We must quit and make a dash for the dinghy. It's
our only chance. Wait!"</p>

<p>He rushed into the smaller room, and returned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
something in his hands. It was the tin box holding the
pearls.</p>

<p>He opened it, emptied the contents wrapped in cotton
wool, and filled his pockets.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to leave these behind," said he,
speaking as if to himself. Then to Isbel: "Take a
revolver and this package of ammunition. I'll take the
other and a rifle. Unbar the door and run first. Don't
stop to fire unless you can't help. Hark! What's
that?"</p>

<p>A sound like a sharp clap of thunder shook the air
and was followed by a yell from the grove behind the
house and from the beach on either side.</p>

<p>"Open the door!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>Isbel undid the bars, and flung the door wide. Instantly
the draft settling from the grove filled the place
with volumes of smoke.</p>

<p>"Now," said Floyd, "run!"</p>

<p>They dashed out of the house, across the beach,
running, half blind with the effects of the smoke. They
had expected a flight of spears. They found instead
an empty beach, full dawn, and a reef over which the
last of their assailants were scrambling.</p>

<p>A great white cloud filled the break of the reef. It
was the <i>Southern Cross</i> coming in with a fair wind
and a flooding tide.</p>

<p>The first rays of the sun were on her topsails, which
the wind scarcely filled. The water under her was still
violet with night. White gulls, rose-colored gulls,
golden gulls, as the sunrise took them, were flocking
and screaming in the pale sapphire above her, schooner,
gulls, lagoon, and sky making a picture more lovely
than a dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>As she cleared the reef entrance and rounded to her
anchorage, the wind spilling out of her sails, a plume
of smoke broke from her, and again the report of a
gun shook the island.</p>

<p>As it died away the splash of the anchor was followed
by a roar of the chain through the hawse pipe,
and the <i>Southern Cross</i>, her long, long journey over,
lay at her moorings swinging to the incoming tide.</p>

<p>Isbel turned to Floyd and clung to him, weeping.
All her courage had suddenly vanished now that there
was no need for it.</p>

<p>Floyd, holding her tight in his arms, kissed her
black, perfumed hair. The flower had fallen, but a
trace of its scent remained.</p>

<p>It was the moment of his life, and then she drew
away from him, cast one dark glance obliquely up at
him, and stood with her breast heaving and both hands
shading her eyes.</p>

<p>She was looking over the water in the direction of
the <i>Southern Cross</i>.</p>

<p>The schooner was lowering a boat. It was the
whaleboat, and Floyd saw the men tumbling into her,
followed by a white-clad figure&mdash;Schumer.</p>

<p>Even at that distance he recognized Schumer. Following
Schumer came another white-clad figure, evidently
a European.</p>

<p>Besides the two white men there were twelve hands
in the boat, fourteen in all, and as she approached
rapidly, urged by the long ash sweeps, Floyd saw the
rifles with which the men were armed, the barrels
showing as they rested, muzzle upward, by the seats.</p>

<p>As the boat came ashore Schumer, from his place in
the stern sheets, waved his hand to Floyd. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
fellows, jumping out, beached the boat, and Schumer,
following them, set foot on the sand.</p>

<p>He did not waste words.</p>

<p>He had seen the whole business at a glance, and he
had brought canvas buckets. Dense columns of smoke
were rising from the back part of the house, but the
roof had fortunately not caught alight. The crew had
their orders, and in a moment they were filling the
buckets and carrying them up to the grove while Schumer,
Floyd, and the newcomer helped and superintended.</p>

<p>The mutineers had piled stacks of underwood, sticks,
and all the rubbish they could find against the house
wall. The stuff was burning with more smoke than
flame, and the fire had fortunately taken no considerable
hold on the building. They kicked the rubbish
aside, flung water on the wall, and in twenty minutes
or so the situation was saved.</p>

<p>Isbel had been posted by Schumer as a lookout in
case the enemy should return. She had not contented
herself by standing by as a watch, but had gone as far
as the grove end, from where the reef could be seen
up to the pierhead. She had seen nothing. The whole
crowd of the enemy, in fact, had scattered back to the
fishing camp by the road they had come the night before,
and Schumer, standing now on the beach, could
see them through his glass congregated about the tents.</p>

<p>Then he turned to Floyd. "Well," said he, "you
seem to have had a lively time. What was the
bother?"</p>

<p>Floyd explained in a few words, and, Isbel not being
by, told of the trouble with Sru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>"He was plotting mischief all the time," said Floyd,
"and this is the result."</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "we will deal with the gentleman
all in good time. What luck have you had with
the pearls?"</p>

<p>Floyd told.</p>

<p>Taking off his coat, and laying it on the sands, he
began to remove the pearls, in their casings of cotton
wool, from the pockets. He explained why he had
placed them there, and, as he went on with the work,
Schumer and the stranger, standing by, looked on.</p>

<p>Schumer up to this had been too busy to introduce
the newcomer. He did so now.</p>

<p>"This is Captain Hakluyt," said he. "He's in this
venture, as I will explain to you afterward. His firm
owns the <i>Southern Cross</i>."</p>

<p>Floyd looked up, and nodded to Hakluyt.</p>

<p>The new man's face was not a certificate of character.
There are faces that repel at first sight, and
Hakluyt's was one of them.</p>

<p>He had the appearance, not so much of a man who
was ill, but of a man who never enjoyed good health.
An&aelig;mic looking despite his exposure to sun and wind,
he seemed unable to bear either the full light of the
sun or a full gaze. He was continually blinking, and
to Floyd in that moment he suggested vividly the idea
of a sick owl.</p>

<p>It was the curve of the nose and the blinking of the
eyelids that produced this impression. The eyes themselves
were not at all owllike, being small and set close
together.</p>

<p>The whole figure of the man matched his face, slight
and mean, with shoulders sloping like the shoulders of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
a champagne bottle. It was a figure that no tailor
could improve.</p>

<p>His hands, as he stood with the thumbs in the armholes
of his waistcoat, showed lean and clawlike, birdlike.
Birdlike is the term best suited for the whole
man; light, restless, peering, and without grace, for it
is a fact that the animal and the bird translated into
human terms lose both grace and nobility. Man
standing or falling by his approach or recession to the type,
man.</p>

<p>As Floyd looked up from his work he took in Hakluyt's
appearance fully for the first time, and the idea
that this man was the new partner in their concern filled
him with repulsion and uneasiness.</p>

<p>He had been on the point of exposing the pearls
triumphantly to view, but in a flash he altered his decision,
and, asking them to wait for a moment, left his
work and ran up to the house for the tin cash box from
which he had taken them.</p>

<p>He placed it on the sand, and packing in the precious
cotton-wool-covered parcels, closed the lid and handed
it to Schumer.</p>

<p>"We can examine them afterward," said he. "Keep
them for the present. They are not a bad lot, but they
might be better."</p>

<p>"We'll put them in the house," replied Schumer.
"I've got a safe on board; brought it from Sydney, but
I can't get it ashore till to-morrow. Meanwhile they'll
be all right in the house. Well, Hakluyt, what do you
think of the island?"</p>

<p>Hakluyt looked about him as though taking stock
of the place for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>"It is not so bad," said he. "It is a fair bit of a
lagoon, but it might be bigger."</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be big enough for us," replied Schumer,
with a laugh. "Come up to the house with me, Floyd,
till I put this stuff away. I want to have a talk with
you."</p>

<p>They left Hakluyt, and walked up to the house.</p>

<p>"I say," said Floyd, "if that's our new man I don't
like the look of him."</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"He's not a beauty," said he, "but he's the best I
could find. He's Hakluyt &amp; Son. He's the son; the
father's dead. He's in a good way of business as a
shipowner and ship's chandler in Sydney. He has got
the money and the means to help us. I have drawn up
a contract with him; he gets a third share."</p>

<p>"A third share. That means that the total profits
will be divided into three parts. One for you, one for
me, and one for Hakluyt."</p>

<p>"Just so," said Schumer, "and you pay me for the
trade goods we salved from the <i>Tonga</i>."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Floyd, "but it seems to me that
Hakluyt ought to stand in with me and pay something."</p>

<p>"I suggested that, but he refused. He would only
come into the deal on condition that he got a third
share of the profits without deduction."</p>

<p>Floyd felt inclined to grumble at this. Hakluyt
would have the benefit of those goods or what was left
of them, but he said nothing. He wanted explanation
on another point.</p>

<p>"How about the <i>Southern Cross</i>?" said he.</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>"Well, we salved her, didn't we, or as good as salved
her? Hakluyt ought to pay for that."</p>

<p>"It was this way," replied Schumer. "Before coming
into the venture he wanted half profits. He gave
me to understand that our connection with the
<i>Southern Cross</i> was in no way a salving job, since the crew
were on board, and he said straight out that he would
fight the matter in the courts. Now, as he has lots of
money to fight with, and we have none, or next to none,
I didn't see any sense in that. He said to me: 'I'll
tell you what I'll do. In recognition of your trouble
in bringing the schooner back to Sydney, I'll be content
to take only a third of the profits in this pearling business.
What's more, I will use the schooner for it free
of charge and victual and man her.'</p>

<p>"Now, that seemed to me a fair proposition, and I
agreed to it. What do you say?"</p>

<p>Floyd did not reply for a moment. He could come
to no decision. The whole thing was so intricate and
the values involved were such unknown qualities that
at last he gave it up. If Schumer was satisfied it was
doubtless all right. Schumer knew more of business
affairs than he did, and it was better to leave it at that.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I suppose you couldn't do better,
but it seems to me Hakluyt won't do badly out of the
business. Wait till I show you something."</p>

<p>They had reached the house, and, taking the cash
box from Schumer, Floyd placed it on the table and
opened it.</p>

<p>He carefully removed some of the contents till he
came to the package he was looking for; then, carefully
removing the cotton wool from it, he exposed the
pink pearl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>"Heavens, man!" said Schumer. "Why didn't you
tell me of this?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>He took another small ball of wool from the box,
unrolled the wool, and held out the big white pearl.</p>

<p>Schumer laughed.</p>

<p>"Any more?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not of that size," replied Floyd. "Well, what
do you think of them?"</p>

<p>"Think of them? They are a fortune in themselves."</p>

<p>He carefully rolled them up again and replaced
them in the box.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Floyd had been unpacking other
specimens, which Schumer examined in their turn. He
seemed well pleased with the take since his absence,
as well he might be.</p>

<p>"I will have the safe brought ashore to-morrow,"
said he. "Meanwhile they will be all right here. Put
them all back and come on. We have to tackle these
scamps now and bring them to their senses. I don't
want any fighting, if possible, for that would mean killing
more of them, and we want them all for the
fishery."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you are going to trust them
to work again?"</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Why, man, it is nothing when
one is working fellows like these to have revolts and
rows. You shouldn't have let them get so much out
of hand. I don't blame you, mind, for you are new to
the business, but in the first instance you should have
dealt properly with Sru. You should have shot him
after that business about the girl. Martial law is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
only law by which you can hold your own in a case like
this. Well, we will see. Take your gun and come
along."</p>

<p>They went out, and Schumer ordered the whaleboat
to be manned.</p>

<p>Floyd for the first time recognized that the crew of
the whaleboat were the same Kanakas who had formed
the original crew of the <i>Southern Cross</i>. Mountain
Joe was one of them. He saluted Floyd when he was
recognized, and then took his place as stroke oar.
Each man had a rifle and seemed to know how to use
it, and they had all the stamp of men reliant and
trained to arms.</p>

<p>They were not the same men&mdash;viewed as fighting
men&mdash;that Schumer had taken away with him. He
had done wonders with them in his absence, and the
thought suddenly occurred to Floyd: Did Schumer
expect that there would be trouble on the island during
his absence? Did he train and arm the crew of the
<i>Southern Cross</i> in view of this possible trouble?</p>

<p>It seemed so.</p>

<p>Then came another thought: Suppose you had been
defeated and killed, would not Schumer have benefited?
There would have been one partner the less,
and ought he not to have warned you more especially
as to the danger of a revolt?</p>

<p>Schumer had, in fact, warned him casually to be on
the lookout, but his warning had chiefly to do with the
cache and the necessity of preventing its locality and
contents from becoming known. He had not dwelt on
the matter of a possible revolt, nor had he prepared
plans to meet it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>Did he hope to return and find a clear field and his
partner put out of the way?</p>

<p>Floyd instantly dismissed the idea as unworthy of
himself and Schumer. He had no tittle of real evidence
to support such an idea&mdash;yet it had occurred to
him.</p>

<p>There are some ideas that arise not from any concrete
basis, but from vague suggestions. This was one
of them.</p>

<p>As they approached the fishing beach they could see
the enemy scuttering about in alarm. Fellows came
out of the tents, shaded their eyes for a second, and
then darted off into the grove. In less than a minute
not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p>"There'll be no fighting," said Schumer as the boat
came to the beach, and they sprang out. "Floyd, you
stay here with the men and I'll take Mountain Joe up
to the wood edge and have a palaver. I'll leave my
gun with you so they may see we've come for peace, not
war. They are sure to be peeping and spying from the
trees."</p>

<p>He left the rifle, and, taking Joe with him, walked
steadily up from the lagoon edge to the grove. Twenty
paces from the trees he stopped and began to speak.</p>

<p>Floyd could hear his voice, and it was strange
enough to see him standing there and seemingly addressing
the trees.</p>

<p>Mountain Joe also put in a word now and then as if
on his own account.</p>

<p>The effect was absolutely negative, and Floyd expected
to see them turn and come back.</p>

<p>But Schumer knew the native mind and its ways, and
he did not seem the least disconcerted at his failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
He paused in his oration, walked up and down a bit,
and then began to talk again.</p>

<p>Presently, not from the trees before him, but from
the trees at the left-hand side of the grove, a native
appeared. He stood for a moment, now resting on one
foot, now on the other. Then he said a few words, to
which Schumer replied.</p>

<p>They kept this up for a minute or so, and then, from
the wood, another native joined the first, then another
and another.</p>

<p>"They are all right now," cried Schumer to Floyd.
"Come up and help to jaw them. Leave your gun
behind."</p>

<p>Floyd handed his rifle to one of the men and came
right up to the group of natives before whom Schumer
was now standing. He was talking to them, to use his
own expression, like a Dutch uncle. Talking as only
he knew how.</p>

<p>The Polynesian native, pick him up in most places,
has a good deal of humor in his composition. He can
both feel and use sarcasm. He has over and above
this a certain bonhomie, a good spirit readily worked
if one knows how.</p>

<p>Schumer knew how. He did not speak them fair
by any means. He told them what was in his mind
about them, told them they were pigs who would have
dashed to their own destruction but for his arrival, yet
told them it in a way that did not stir resentment.</p>

<p>These half-civilized creatures had been cast right
back into savagery by some influence beyond their control.
Sru had not been the influence, but he had worked
it, just as a sorcerer might raise a devil.</p>

<p>Sru had not yet made his appearance. Schumer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
asked for him, and the reply came that he was dead and
lying over somewhere in the grove near the house.
One of the stray shots fired by Floyd while the brushwood
was being placed against the house wall had
found Sru and sent him to his last account.</p>

<p>"Well," said Schumer, "that's the best news we have
had yet. It clears up everything. You don't want
to punish these fellows, do you? Seems to me you
have given them a pretty good grueling already, three
dead and several wounded."</p>

<p>"I don't want to punish them," said Floyd. "You
can tell them I call it quits. Sru was the man most to
blame, and now he is dead. But there is one man I
have a grudge against&mdash;Timau&mdash;and I don't see him
here."</p>

<p>"Timau," said Schumer. "Which one is that?"</p>

<p>"He's a fellow whose life I saved at a great deal of
risk and trouble. He stepped into one of those big
clamshells and got seized, and I managed to free him,
but he's not here."</p>

<p>Schumer turned to the natives and asked them where
Timau was; then he translated to Floyd.</p>

<p>"It seems he wouldn't take part in the business because
you had brought him back from the dead."</p>

<p>"So I did, with artificial respiration."</p>

<p>"Just so&mdash;and Sru bound him and put him in one of
the tents. He's there now. We had better go and
loose him."</p>

<p>They walked up to the tents, and there sure enough
they found Timau lying on his side and chewing tobacco.
He had managed to get one arm free and could
have freed himself entirely had he taken the trouble.
He had not. He just lay there, chewing and waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
on events. He was the laziest of the whole crowd employed
on the fishery, and since his return from death
he seemed to take everything as a fatalist.</p>

<p>But he had refused to join in the attack on Floyd.</p>

<p>Schumer undid his bonds, and he stood up, stretched
himself, grunted, and walked off to join the others.</p>

<p>Schumer looked after him.</p>

<p>"He's a cool customer. Well, there's an end of the
business. To-morrow they will all be working again,
except the dead men. Now let's get back and bury
Sru. We'll have to hunt for him in the grove. Then
you can come on board and we will have something to
eat. You haven't had breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Lord, no!" replied Floyd. "I had a sort of supper
some time in the night, but what I want most is sleep.
I'll lie down and have a snooze when we have finished
up with Sru."</p>

<p>They came back to the house, and then started out
to find what the grove had to reveal to them.</p>

<p>The cache had been half rifled, but most of the goods
that had been taken were still lying on the sands and
had not been injured.</p>

<p>Then they found Sru lying at the foot of an artus
tree, a broken spear in his hand. He was lying on his
face, and he would not trouble them any more.</p>

<p>Schumer buried him after a fashion of his own. He
ordered two of the crew to carry the deceased to the
pierhead at the break in the reef and cast him to the
sharks.</p>

<p>"They'll look after him," said he.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>HAKLUYT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day work resumed as usual, Hakluyt assisting,
or, at least, standing by to watch the proceedings.</p>

<p>The mutineers had destroyed nothing. All the shell
that had been taken since the beginning of the work
was intact, and the oysters that lay awaiting search
when the revolt broke out were still there, lying where
they had been left. As though fate wished to stimulate
Hakluyt's interest in the business on this the first
day of resumption of work the take proved to be exceptionally
good. Three large pearls of good size and
form came to hand besides several of less value.</p>

<p>"You mustn't reckon every day's take by this," said
Schumer. "Often there's nothing much. In this business
it's the take of a week or month that counts."</p>

<p>"All the same it is good," said Hakluyt. He spoke
as though there were some obstruction in his nasal organ,
and Floyd, listening to him and watching him, felt
more than ever the aversion for him that had influenced
him so powerfully on their first meeting.</p>

<p>Hakluyt watched all the proceedings just as a predatory
bird watches its prey. He stood with his thumbs
in the armholes of his waistcoat&mdash;his favorite attitude&mdash;a
cigar in his mouth, and his panama hat tilted back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>He had a habit of thrusting his head forward, tortoise-like&mdash;one
might have fancied that his neck was telescopic
like the neck of a tortoise&mdash;and continually he
kept drumming on his chest with his finger tips. On
the middle finger of his left hand he wore a huge ring
set with a diamond, an adornment that did not match
with the shabby suit of white drill that flapped about
him in the wind, showing to full disadvantage the thinness
of his legs and arms and the protuberance of his
stomach.</p>

<p>"That chap," thought Floyd to himself, "would do
anything short of murder&mdash;and maybe wouldn't stop
at that."</p>

<p>Isbel also did not seem to have much liking for Hakluyt.</p>

<p>With the return of Schumer, Isbel had gone right
back to her previous position in the social scale of the
island and also to her home in the grove. She helped
in the cooking as before, and she kept watch for ships
when Floyd and his companions were over at the fishing
grounds, but beyond that she had little to do with
them.</p>

<p>From the moment of the landing of Schumer she had
avoided Floyd. It was as though a veil had suddenly
fallen between them after that moment when suddenly
released from death she had clung to him as
they stood watching the <i>Southern Cross</i> casting anchor.
She had drawn away, and now it was as though
nothing had ever been between them at all, as though
they had never fought together and lived together and
faced death together.</p>

<p>Floyd, simple soul, could not understand her in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
least. At first he was perplexed, thought he had done
something to offend her, and tried to imagine what it
could be. Then he sulked&mdash;turned his head away
when she drew near and avoided speaking to her.</p>

<p>One day, a week after the return of Schumer, he
was on the windward side of the reef behind the grove
and the house. Schumer and Hakluyt were over at
the fishing camp. It was an hour before noon, and he
had finished the work he had been upon and was seated
on a lump of coral watching the breakers coming in,
a wonderful vision of sunlit foam.</p>

<p>The breeze brought the spray almost to his feet,
and a scent of ozone and seaweed and salt that seemed
to come from the very heart of the sea.</p>

<p>As he sat like this a shadow fell on the coral before
him, and, turning, he saw Isbel.</p>

<p>She sat down beside him.</p>

<p>He had been thinking of her, and nothing could
have surprised him more than this action of hers in
coming and sitting beside him. He moved slightly as
though to make room for her, and then turned his face
seaward again.</p>

<p>A frigate bird was approaching the island, moving
without an effort on the wind. They watched it as it
came along. Its shadow passed over them and vanished,
and Floyd, turning his head to take a last look
at the bird, found himself face to face with his companion.</p>

<p>Isbel had not spoken a word, but now, as their eyes
met, her lips moved as though she were whispering
something to herself impossible to say aloud. She
seemed like a person in a trance, and her eyes, wide-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>pupiled
and fixed on those of her companion, seemed
trying to tell something impossible to tell by speech.</p>

<p>Next moment he had taken her in his arms. For a
moment she resisted slightly, as though that soul,
strange and free as the soul of the sea bird, were struggling
feebly against the final capture of man.</p>

<p>Then she raised her lips to his.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>ORDERED TO SYDNEY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Schumer took Floyd aside.</p>

<p>"Hakluyt is well pleased with the work here,"
said he. "He thinks the prospects even better than I
made them out to him, and now he wants to go back."</p>

<p>"Does he?" said Floyd. The news came as a pleasant
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, he has got his business in Sydney to attend to
and he's keen on getting back at once. Of course he
goes in the <i>Southern Cross</i>, but he can't go alone, for
the schooner has to be brought back."</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"You must go with him," said Schumer. "There
is no one else for the job."</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed Floyd.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is no one else. I have been away too
long. In fact I only got back in time to save the situation.
You are a very good fellow, Floyd, but you
aren't much use for working natives. It's not your
business in life; it is mine."</p>

<p>"But see here," said the other, "why can't Hakluyt
send the schooner back with another man in charge?
There are lots of men in Sydney who could do the
job."</p>

<p>"Yes, and what would that mean? Letting another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
man into our secrets. Surely you are not against
doing your share of the work."</p>

<p>"I!" cried Floyd, flushing. "Have I ever refused
to do all in my power to help? Of course I will go.
Only, the thing has come on me as a surprise, and, I
will say it frankly, an unpleasant surprise. You say
Hakluyt wants to go back at once. Well, I think you
might have told me of it some days ago. You must
have known all along."</p>

<p>"I did not," said Schumer. "Of course I knew he
wanted to go, but I did not know he wanted to go so
soon. What does it matter? You have no
preparations to make."</p>

<p>"How about the navigating on the way back?"
asked Floyd, ignoring the last remark. "You had
Hakluyt to help you coming, but if I am to come back
single-handed it seems to me I will be in a bad way."</p>

<p>"You will have Mountain Joe," replied Schumer.
"I have given special attention to that gentleman's
education on the voyage to Sydney and back. You
remember he could work out a dead reckoning even when I
took him in hand. He was absolutely useless by
himself, but under guidance he could be quite useful. Well,
he knows a lot more now, and if I could get to Sydney
with him as he was then, you can surely get back from
Sydney with him as he is now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose that will be all right," said Floyd.
"And what am I to do in Sydney besides dumping
Hakluyt there?"</p>

<p>"You will unlade the shell which I am sending and
take in some more provisions. The <i>Southern Cross</i>
wants an overhaul&mdash;that will take a week or ten days&mdash;she
wants some new spars and a few barnacles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
scraped off her. We want a big lot of canned stuff,
vegetables, and bully beef. I'll talk to you to-night
about that. Hakluyt is in the way of getting it cheaper
than we could if we were working alone."</p>

<p>"How long do you think we will have to stay in
Sydney?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about three weeks or so."</p>

<p>"It will be over two months before I can get back."</p>

<p>"About that."</p>

<p>"And when exactly do you want me to start?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in a couple of days. It will take us that to get
the shell aboard. I am going to start on the work this
morning. I'll get all the hands on it, crew and fishermen
both. We can get the stuff on board on the raft
and with the help of the whaleboat."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Floyd, "I'll go."</p>

<p>He turned away and walked along the lagoon edge.
Always when Fortune turned toward him she had
something unpleasant to add to her gifts. The pink
pearl had been followed by the running away of Isbel,
and the great white pearl by the mutiny of the hands.
Isbel had been given to him only yesterday, and now
he had to leave her.</p>

<p>Since yesterday he had lived in a state of extraordinary
happiness. Wonderland. To love and to
find that you are loved. There is nothing else. No
dream can come near this reality. And now he had
to leave her.</p>

<p>He crossed the reef, and stood looking out to sea.
The Pacific lay blazing beneath the morning light,
blue beyond the sun dazzle and heaving shoreward to
burst in foam at his feet. The breeze came fresh
across it, vivid and full of life. Floyd loved the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>It had become part of his nature and part of his being.
It was his second mother. But to-day he was looking
at it with fresh eyes. It was no longer the sea; it was
separation from all he cared for and all he loved. He
would have to leave Isbel and leave her with Schumer.</p>

<p>When he had landed on the island first, Schumer
had impressed him favorably, but little by little and by
that slow process through which a complex and illusive
personality makes its quality known to a simple and
straightforward mind, he had come to the point of distrust
as regards Schumer.</p>

<p>He had no fear at all that Schumer would harm Isbel.
Isbel was a person who could well take care of
herself, and Schumer, he distinctly felt, was not a man
dangerous to women. The instinctive feeling of danger
had to do with himself. He was a fifth wheel in
Schumer's chariot, an absorber of profits, and though
he refused the thought that Schumer might attempt to
get rid of him, he could not refuse the instinct.</p>

<p>He felt suddenly surrounded by an atmosphere of
danger none the less disturbing from the fact that he
could not tell from what point it arose. He disliked
this journey to Sydney, and he disliked Hakluyt even
more.</p>

<p>Brave as any man could be, he feared for his own
safety, not for his own sake, but for the sake of Isbel.
Should anything happen to him what would become of
her?</p>

<p>And there was nothing he could do. He was completely
in the grasp of events. He could not refuse to
perform this obvious duty that had suddenly been
laid down before him by Schumer. He could not take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Isbel with him, and he could not take any precautions
as to his own safety beyond simple watchfulness.</p>

<p>He turned back from the sea, and as he turned he
saw Isbel. She was standing at the edge of the grove,
and the trees quite sheltered them from the sight of the
people by the house. He came toward her, and they
entered the grove together.</p>

<p>Close to the sea edge of the grove a huge tree had
fallen. Rotten with age, it had crashed its way through
the lesser trees and lay like a dead giant over which
the undergrowth had cast its green skirts in part.
They sat down upon it, and Isbel, nestling up close
beside him, rested her head upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Then he told her that he was going. Told her the
whole thing and the reasons that held him. Told her
that the separation would only be for a little while, and
surely, surely he would come back, and as he talked
and explained he felt her shudder as a person shudders
from the cold.</p>

<small>GOOD-BY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">All</span> that morning and all that day Schumer kept
the hands busy at work bringing the shell across
the lagoon and storing it aboard the <i>Southern Cross</i>.
Some of it was rafted over and some brought in the
whaleboat. Schumer superintended everything himself,
and now that speed was urgent he proved what
he could do as a driver.</p>

<p>Never did a Yankee stevedore work a set of hands
harder. His voice acted as a whiplash, and his energy
infected everybody.</p>

<p>Next day it was the same, so that at sundown the
last of the shell was on board, the locking bars secured,
and nothing remained but to take on the water.</p>

<p>"We can do that to-night," said Schumer, "and if
this wind holds, though there is not much of it, you
will be able to start at sunup. It will be slack tide
about then. Now, if you will come up to the house, I
will give you the last details of what you have to do in
Sydney. There is nothing like having everything cut
and dried."</p>

<p>They went up to the house, and Schumer at once
plunged into accounts. He had tabulated a list of all
the stores required, and he had written down the main
points in Floyd's program, even to the address of a
house where he could stay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>Hakluyt looked on while the two men talked, and,
when they had finished, the three went out, Hakluyt
and Schumer to see to the watering of the vessel and
Floyd to find Isbel.</p>

<p>It was a night of the full moon, a hot, almost
windless, night filled with the scent of flowers and the song
of the reef.</p>

<p>The moon hung almost in the zenith, the apex of a
pyramid of light, and under the silent whiteness of the
moon the island lay clipping the vast pond of the
lagoon in its arms as a mistress holds her lover.</p>

<p>Hakluyt and Schumer had taken the boat to fetch
the water casks, and from away out over the water
came the sound of the oars. The fellows over at the
fishing camp were singing, untired by their day's work,
and now and then on a stronger puff of wind a snatch
of their song came over the lagoon water, and, just
for a moment, as Floyd stood by the water edge, all
his trouble of mind lifted from him&mdash;for a moment.
The brilliant light, the beauty of the scene before him,
the snatch of song from the fishing camp, and the
perfume of the flower-scented wind seemed to open doors
in his mind through which from some remote past came
happiness. The moonlight for a moment caught some
magic from the morning of the world. Then he turned
and went toward the outer reef edge, where Isbel was
waiting for him.</p>

<div class="gap-25"></div>

<p>An hour before dawn the beach before the house
was astir. The moon had sunk, but the stars gave
enough light to work by. The water was all aboard,
and now some coconuts, breadfruit, and taro roots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
were being taken off. Floyd was directing operations.
He had said good-by to Isbel, who was nowhere to
be seen. He sat in the stern sheets of the fruit boat,
steering, and when the stuff was transshipped he
boarded the <i>Southern Cross</i> and sent the empty boat
back for Schumer and Hakluyt.</p>

<p>Schumer came on board, and stood chatting while
the hands were at the capstan bars getting the slack of
the anchor chain in. Then when the mainsail was
being set and the hands were at the halyards, Schumer
slipped over the side into the boat and pushed off for
shore.</p>

<p>As the anchor came up, Floyd, who was forward
superintending the men, left Joe to see to the securing
of it and came aft to where Hakluyt was standing by
the wheel.</p>

<p>The dawn was now bright in a sky that showed
scarcely a trace of morning bank. It came over the
reef and between the palms, whose trunks stood like
bars against the brightening east. It flooded the lagoon
as the schooner gathered way, and the great
trapezium of the mainsail showed a tip of rose gold
as they passed the pierheads of the reef. On the pierhead
to port something showed white against the coral.
It was Isbel.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i> rose to the swell at the break
of the reef just as a horse rises to a low fence, the
foam roared in her wake, and the noise of it mixed
with the clatter of the rudder chain as the fellow at
the wheel twirled the spokes. Floyd raised his hand,
and Isbel signaled in reply as the wind, now gaining its
morning strength, pressed the schooner over to the
tune of straining cordage and creaking blocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Floyd, leaning on the after rail, looked backward.
The little figure of Isbel was no longer to be seen, blotted
out by distance. Then distance took the reef, leaving
only a trace of palm tops above the blazing water,
and in an hour the Island of Pearls had vanished like
a dream beyond the edge of the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>SYDNEY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Hakluyt</span>, despite his appearance, was a very
efficient schooner captain, and as day followed
day, Floyd's respect for him as a sailor rose more and
more. As a man, he disliked him just as much as
ever.</p>

<p>It was not an active dislike. His temper never rose
against him, for Hakluyt, to give him his due, was
perfectly easy to get on with. He neither swore at
the hands nor heckled the subordinate officer. On the
contrary, he seemed always endeavoring to make himself
agreeable, always anxious for smooth water. The
dislike that Floyd had for him was instinctive and beyond
the reach of reason, but he did not show it outwardly
as he would have done had Hakluyt been difficult
to get on with.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i> was a good deal of a Dutch
ship. Hakluyt hailed originally from Amsterdam, and
he brought the Dutch flavor with him. He was an
eternal cigar smoker, and the food and drink on board
were reminiscent of Holland, especially the De Kuyper.
There was a certain slackness also, and a go-as-you-please
method of doing this foreign to an English
ship.</p>

<p>Yet she made good way without taking any risk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
The great art of schooner sailing as laid down by
Hakluyt was formulated by him as follows: "Carry
all the canvas that you can without danger to your
sticks."</p>

<p>And this art implied not only good handling of your
vessel, but incessant weather watchfulness, at all events
in the Pacific, where squalls drop on you out of a perfectly
fair sky.</p>

<p>Three weeks brought them to Sydney, and though
it was not Floyd's first acquaintance with the harbor
which seems to have been made when the gods were
making harbors for great fleets that have vanished, it
still filled him with the same wonder and admiration
and surprise.</p>

<p>They anchored close to McGinnis' wharf, and Floyd
on the morning of his arrival found himself a comparatively
free man for a few days.</p>

<p>"Run round the town and amuse yourself," said
Hakluyt. "Id is worth seeing. Id is good to stretch
one's legs after a voyage, but first come to my place
and I will show you over."</p>

<p>Hakluyt had two places, one on the wharves and
the other an office on Market Street.</p>

<p>The office was a dingy-looking place with wire blinds
to the windows inscribed with the legend "Hakluyt &amp;
Son" done in dingy gold.</p>

<p>The place on the wharf was much more lively and
pleasing to the mind.</p>

<p>It was an enormous emporium where everything was
sold that could be wanted by a shipmaster. Here you
could buy an oilskin coat or the provisions for a voyage
round the world. It was all the same to Hakluyt. He
could put you in the way of a spare anchor or a barrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of petroleum or a slush tub with the same hand that
dealt out tobacco and preserved fruit. His storehouses
were enormous; he victualed his own ships, and his influence
in the maritime world was ubiquitous.</p>

<p>A man who can give you a job if you are out of
work or if your board of trade certificates are not quite
clear is a power. A man who can lend you money
and who is willing to do it if you are on your beam
ends is also a power.</p>

<p>Hakluyt had helped many a man. He had
established that reputation, yet the men he helped had better
have gone without his help, for once he touched a
man in this way he held him. The money he lent always,
nearly always, returned to him with heavy interest.
Sometimes he made a dead loss. He did not mind
that, for he was a man who reckoned up things in the
large, and in the large he always profited, with this
addition&mdash;he could always put his hand on a man ready
and able to do a dangerous or dirty job for him.</p>

<p>Floyd, when Hakluyt had shown him over the
wharfside store, took his gear to the house recommended
by Schumer, where he obtained rooms. Then
he went out to see the town, and finished up by dining
at a restaurant and going to the theater.</p>

<p>Next morning he went down to superintend the towing
of the <i>Southern Cross</i> into dry dock for an overhaul.
This business held him for most of the day, and
most of the next day he spent at the dock having a
good look at the vessel's copper sheathing. It seemed
to him that the dry docking was a work of supererogation.
The <i>Southern Cross</i> was in excellent condition,
and Hakluyt was not the man to waste money in frills.
Why had he gone to this expense?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>There were several of Hakluyt's ships in the
harbor, and chumming up with one of the wharfside loafers,
he managed to obtain a good deal of information
as to Hakluyt and his ships.</p>

<p>Said the broken-down sailorman, who was one reek
of rum and navy twist:</p>

<p>"<i>Southern Cross</i> in dry dock havin' her bottom
scraped? I dunno in the nation what bee's got into
Hakluyt's bonnet. There's the <i>Mary and Louise</i>&mdash;that's
her lyin' by the oil tank&mdash;the weeds fathoms
long on her keel and the barnacles as big as saucers
on her copper, yet she's good enough to put out o' port
without no dry dockin'. There's the <i>Boomerang</i>, another
of his tubs. You can see her forrard, the yaller
one, beyond that point. She's wrong from stem to
rudder, she's held together mostly by her paint, she
hasn't seen a dry dock for years, an' the sight of one
would make her spew her bolts. I reckon she's just
held together by the salt water she floats in, yet he
docks the <i>Southern Cross</i>! Is that all his vessels?
No, it ain't. D'you see that schooner out there by the
whistlin' buoy? She's the <i>Domain</i>. She's Hakluyt's.
Just come back from the islands a month ago. Been
lyin' there waitin' for I don't know what ever since.
The copra's been out of her this fortnight, and there
she lays waitin' her job.</p>

<p>"What sort o' man is Hakluyt? Well, he's no sort
to speak of. He blew in here twenty years ago out of
a Dutch ship that was glad to get rid of him, and here
he's stuck and prospered till he's fair rotten with
money and has his thumb on the town and half the
harbor side as well. He's owner and ship's chandler
both. I've heard folk say he's sold his soul to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
devil, but that's a lie, for he ain't got a soul to sell.
The grub aboard his ships is most salt horse, and the
bread bags has to be tethered they're that lively with
the weevils. Go and ask any sailorman on the front
if you don't believe me."</p>

<p>Floyd did not need to confirm this view of Hakluyt
by making inquiries of sailormen on the front. He
took a long look at the <i>Domain</i>, and then turned away
from the wharfside and walked uptown to Hakluyt's
office.</p>

<p>Hakluyt was in, and they went over the list of stores
together.</p>

<p>"You leave id all with me," said Hakluyt. "I shall
have them all aboard by the date of sailing. Well,
and how do you like Sydney?"</p>

<p>Floyd expressed his opinion of Sydney. The dullest
place in the world for a lone man unaddicted to bar-room
festivity or horse-racing. Hakluyt gave him a
pass for the theater, regretted that he could not ask
him to dinner, as he was a lone bachelor, told him to
enjoy himself, and dismissed him.</p>

<p>During the next fortnight Floyd managed to amuse
himself innocently enough. He had never been much
of a reading man, but, picking up a cheap edition of
the "Count of Monte Cristo," he suddenly found a
new world open before him. He read it in bed at
night, and he took it out with him and read it by the
sea front.</p>

<p>It occupied a good deal of his time, as he was a
slow reader, and it gave him a new horizon and new
ideas and a new energy.</p>

<p>Monte Cristo's discovery of the treasure, his escape
from the Chteau d'If, the girl he loved, his cruel sepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>ration
from her, his revenge, all these things appealed
to his mind with the power of reality, as they have
appealed to minds all the world over and as they ever
will appeal.</p>

<p>When he had finished "Monte Cristo," he bought a
new novel. It was about a young lady, who, starting
life as a shop assistant, married a duke at the end of
the third chapter. The book did not hold him, and
he fell back on fishing.</p>

<p>There is good fishing to be had in the neighborhood
of Sydney, and one day toward the end of the third
week and close now to the time of the sailing of the
<i>Southern Cross</i>, he met an individual on one of these
fishing excursions, a joyous and friendly personage
who, returning with him to Sydney, proposed drinks
and led the way into a bar.</p>

<p>Floyd was not a drinking man, but the best of men
make mistakes, and the hot air of the bar, the friendliness
of his new companion, the pleasure of having some
one to talk to, and the strength of the whisky had their
effect. He had not eaten since breakfast.</p>

<p>Presently he found himself one of a mixed company.
His first acquaintance had departed, yet he did not
trouble about that. He scarcely recognized the fact,
and presently he recognized nothing. He had been
doped. One of these new friends had done the business,
and an hour later he found himself lying on a
couch in Hakluyt's inner office, of all places in the
world, his pockets empty and his throat like a fiery furnace.</p>

<p>He recognized at once his position. He had been
robbed and left in the street and had managed to reach
Hakluyt's by that instinct for a known place common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
to homing pigeons and drunken men, an instinct that
in the man is much more tricky than in the bird, as in
the case of Floyd, who, instead of finding himself in
his rooms, found himself at Hakluyt's.</p>

<p>His mind, as he lay there on the couch, was terribly
lucid. He remembered everything up to a certain
point.</p>

<p>It was still daylight, so that his intoxication must
have passed away very quickly, as it does in those instances
where it is produced by a doper and through
the medium of a "knock-out drop" placed in the victim's
drink; but Floyd knew nothing of this. He did
not suspect that he had been doped by some scoundrel
for the purpose of robbery. He only recognized that
he had been drunk and incapable, and, to use the old
term so unfair to animals, had made a beast of himself.</p>

<p>The awful depression that comes after drink or
drugs had a hold upon him, and the unfair spirit that
waits upon depression of this sort began to exercise its
power.</p>

<p>It showed him the vision of Isbel standing on the
reef against a background of blue and burning sea; it
showed him the coconut trees and breadfruits, their
fronds and foliage moving in the wind; it showed him
all that was brilliant and fresh and pure in that extraordinary
life through which he had passed out there,
away from civilization and its dirt, and then it showed
himself lying in Hakluyt's dusty office recovering from
drink and fortunate in not having been jailed.</p>

<p>It seemed to his simple mind that he had sinned
against Isbel and that he never, never could rise from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
his degradation and look in her face again. All his
homesickness for the island came upon him like a
wave, and he was endeavoring to raise himself on his
arm to leave the couch when a voice from the outer
office made him lie down again.</p>

<p>It was Hakluyt's voice. He had just entered, and
Floyd, as he lay, heard the door of the outer office
close.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hakluyt, who seemed to be continuing
a conversation begun outside, "id is just so. There is
noding to fear. Wait for a moment, though."</p>

<p>He came to the door of the inner office where Floyd
was lying, pushed it more widely open, and peeped in.</p>

<p>Floyd, more from shame than any other reason, lay
with his eyes closed.</p>

<p>Hakluyt stood looking at him for a few seconds,
then he closed the door.</p>

<p>Floyd instantly opened his eyes and sat up on the
couch.</p>

<p>Hakluyt and the other man, whoever he might be,
had been talking about him. Of that he felt certain.
He had no concrete evidence to go upon, yet he felt
sure that he had been under discussion and that they
were discussing him now. His ego had become abnormally
sensitive, fortunately for him. He felt sure that
his disgraceful conduct was the subject of their talk,
and the overmastering desire to hear the worst that
could be said of him prompted him to leave the couch,
approach the door, and put his ear to the paneling.
He heard Hakluyt's voice and every word that he said
distinctly.</p>

<p>"Look here, Captain Luckman," said Hakluyt,
"when I say a thing I mean id. You need have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
fear. Schumer will see that there is no evidence
against you. You will dispose of the young man so
that no trouble will be made, no questions asked. You
will not raise the price on me on that account. You
run no risk. That is all Schumer's work, and no blood
need be spilled. Schumer is nod the man to make any
blunder. Two hundred pounds now and two hundred
when you get back. That is my uldimatum, and what
have you to do for that&mdash;noding, <i>absolutely</i> noding."</p>

<p>"I'm not troubling about what Schumer does to the
blighter," came Luckman's voice. "I'm thinking of
myself, and I say it's not enough. Two-fifty down and
two-fifty when I get back is <i>my</i> ultimatum, and poor
enough pay it is for a job like that."</p>

<p>Floyd heard Hakluyt laugh. Just a single laugh,
mirthless as a rap on a coffin lid.</p>

<p>"So you would dictate terms to me," said he.
"Why, God bless my soul," his voice rising in inflection,
"suppose I order you from my office, suppose I
say to you, 'Get clear out of this place, Captain Luckman,
and never you ender id again,' hey? Suppose I
say to you, 'Very well, Captain Luckman, all those
papers in my hands go to the owners of the <i>Morning
Star</i>. Sent anonymous.' Suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, stow that!" came Luckman's voice. "Suppose
I put the mouth of a revolver at your head and blow
out your dirty brains? I'd do that same as I'd poison
a rat, if you cut any capers with my affairs. You're
not going to frighten me with threats. Put me beyond
a certain point and I'd do you up before the authorities
could nab me, and if they did nab me I'd croak you
when I came out of quod. Talk like a man to a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
or I'll leave your office and let you do your own dirty
work. Who else is there in Sydney you could get?"</p>

<p>"Hundreds," said Hakluyt.</p>

<p>"Not one," replied Luckman. "Not one who
would not either mess it or give the show away in
drink sometime or another. Five hundred is my price.
Two-fifty down, two-fifty when I land back. Not a
halfpenny less will I take."</p>

<p>In the momentary silence that followed, Floyd heard
a drawer opened, and then came Hakluyt's voice counting:
"One, two, three, four&mdash;<i>and</i> five."</p>

<p>Then Luckman's:</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> five. Right you are."</p>

<p>The money was being paid over, and from the
chinking sound it was being paid in gold, five bags of
fifty sovereigns each, evidently.</p>

<p>Floyd did not wait for any more. He went back
to the couch. He had forgotten his position, he had
forgotten the drinking bout, he no longer even felt
the headache and the parching thirst that had tormented
him on waking. Hakluyt and Schumer had
made a plan to get rid of him. That was all he knew
for the moment. The idea excluded everything else
by its monstrosity and strangeness.</p>

<p>The discovery that a plot is on foot against one's
life is the most soul-stirring discovery that a man can
make. The knowledge that one is an object of enmity
is always disturbing. It unsettles the placidity of the
ego, almost more than the discovery that one is an
object of love. It also raises the temperature of the
soul.</p>

<p>But the discovery that one is plotted against with
a view to one's removal from the world is a heart-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>chilling
discovery which at all events in the first moments
reduces the temperature of the soul and body
both.</p>

<p>Floyd, taking his place on the couch again, closed
his eyes. He heard the two men go out; then after
a moment he heard Hakluyt return.</p>

<p>Hakluyt opened the door and looked in on him,
and Floyd, moving and pretending to wake up, rubbed
his eyes. Then he sat up, asked in a confused manner
where he was, got on his legs, pretended to stagger,
and made for the door.</p>

<p>Hakluyt, nothing loath to get rid of him, followed
him to the stair top.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to now?" inquired Hakluyt, as
the other went down the stairs clutching the banister
tightly.</p>

<p>"Going to have a drink," replied Floyd. "See you
in the morning."</p>

<p>"Right," said Hakluyt. "Take care of yourself."</p>

<p>In the street Floyd turned into the nearest bar,
drank a bottle of soda water, and, having sat for a
moment to collect his wits, started for his rooms. He
had now entirely recovered mastery of himself. His
discovery about Hakluyt was finer than any pick-me-up
or tonic, and his mind before the problem clearly
stated by fate had little inclination for sleep.</p>

<p>The problem itself, though clearly stated, was intricate
and in some respects obscure. If Hakluyt and
Schumer wanted to clear him out of the pearl business,
if they were scoundrels enough to plot his destruction,
why did they not commit the act themselves without
calling in a third man? He could imagine no answer
to this question that satisfied him, yet there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
two answers that might have been put forward by a
man with a knowledge of Schumer and Hakluyt, a
knowledge of psychology and a knowledge of the
world.</p>

<p>Firstly, neither Schumer nor Hakluyt might be murderers
in an active sense. Very few men are capable&mdash;God
be thanked&mdash;of taking a fellow man's life in
cold blood with their own hands. Schumer was without
doubt a man of sensibility and parts. Hakluyt,
though without parts or sensibility, was not of the
active type of scoundrel. Both of these men might
be capable of planning the destruction of another man,
but neither would be likely to do the work himself.</p>

<p>Secondly, in a business of this sort it is always safer
for the murderer to employ an agent than to act himself.</p>

<p>It is the assassin who leaves traces, the assassin who
is followed, the assassin who is hanged.</p>

<p>Of course, he may accuse his employer, but an employer
of the type of Schumer or of Hakluyt is not
likely to give an agent any chance to make evidence
against him. He had paid Luckman in gold, and when
the job was finished he would pay him in gold. Gold
cannot be traced&mdash;and that is one of the greatest pities
in the world.</p>

<p>Floyd could see nothing very clearly in the whole of
this business with the exception of the fact that foul
play was to be used against him, but he saw that fact
clearly enough. Leaving the problem of Schumer and
Hakluyt aside, he tried to imagine what method Luckman
might possibly employ. The remainder of the
money was not to be paid to Luckman until his return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Return from where? There could be only one answer
to that&mdash;from the sea.</p>

<p>Luckman would sail with the <i>Southern Cross</i>, be put
on board either as mate or supercargo; and on the
voyage he would do what he was paid to do.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i> would most likely never reach
the island. An accident would happen to Floyd, and
she would return to Sydney. Luckman would be paid
off for his job, and Hakluyt, taking charge of the
schooner, would sail for the island and shake hands
with Schumer over the fact that they two were the
sole possessors of the place and its wealth.</p>

<p>And what would happen to Isbel?</p>

<p>At this thought a wave of fury rose in his
soul against the men whom he imagined to be plotting
his destruction.</p>

<p>He half rose from his bed, and had Hakluyt appeared
at that moment it would have been a very bad
thing for the shipowner.</p>

<p>Then he lay down, a deep determination in his
heart to deal with this matter in the only way it could
be dealt with satisfactorily, to match cunning against
cunning, and force, at the proper moment, against
force.</p>

<p>He determined to say nothing and do nothing to
arouse any uneasiness or suspicion in Hakluyt, to welcome
Luckman on board, and then to deal with
Luckman when they were clear of the Heads.</p>

<p>If Luckman were put on board as mate or supercargo
the matter would be easy, but if Luckman were
placed over him as captain it would be much more difficult.</p>

<p>If Hakluyt were to suggest such a thing he deter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>mined
to oppose it, to stand on his dignity and refuse
utterly to give up his post as chief in command to a
stranger.</p>

<p>Then as he lay down again the thought came to
him what a miraculous and providential thing it was
that he had gone out fishing that day and fallen in with
the bibulous stranger. He had been robbed, it is true,
of a few pounds, but that was a very cheap price to
pay for his life.</p>

<p>Floyd, without being a professedly religious man,
had a deep and intuitive belief in a God that rules
the world and deals out justice and protects&mdash;though
sometimes in a roundabout way&mdash;the innocent. He
felt that Providence had a hand in this affair, yet he
was not of the type that believes in a Providence who
works single-handed. He determined that in this matter
he would give Providence all the help he could, and
having come to this determination he fell asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>CARDON</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Floyd presented himself early at
the office of Hakluyt &amp; Son, and Hakluyt received
him with some very bald jokes about his condition
on the day before.</p>

<p>Floyd was not in a temper to take them, and indicated
as much. Then they fell to discussing stores and
the sailing of the <i>Southern Cross</i>. The stores were all
on board, and the crew were ready. "I had thought
of your sailing on Friday," said Hakluyt, "but Friday
is not a good day; Thursday is better; that is the day
after to-morrow. Will you be ready to sail on Thursday?"</p>

<p>Floyd asked nothing better, and said so; then he
waited, expecting Hakluyt to broach the subject of
Captain Luckman, but Hakluyt did not say a word
about that gentleman. They talked of a good many
things, but Luckman's name was never mentioned.</p>

<p>Floyd left the office perplexed and more disturbed
than he would have been had Hakluyt announced his
intention of superseding him as captain by appointing
Luckman to the post.</p>

<p>Was Luckman to be sprung upon him at the last
moment? Apparently so.</p>

<p>He turned down Market Street. So deep in thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
was he that the passers-by were unnoticed. He
walked without aim or object for some two hundred
yards till at the corner of Fore Street he was brought
to reality by a hand laid on his arm.</p>

<p>He turned, and found himself face to face with a
tall, bearded man, wearing a slouch hat, roughly
dressed yet somehow well-to-do looking, bronzed,
hearty, and healthy with sun and open-air life.</p>

<p>"Captain Cardon!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>"You passed me as if you didn't know me," said
the other, laughing. "And I'm Captain Cardon no
more; plain Jack Cardon, gold prospector, and down
on his luck&mdash;that's me. Where the deuce have you
sprung from?"</p>

<p>"You don't look particularly down on your luck,"
said Floyd. "Me? I've sprung from the islands&mdash;let's
go somewhere and have a talk."</p>

<p>"You come with me," said Cardon, turning and
leading the way down Fore Street. "Well, this is a
bit of good fortune. I was crazy for the sight of
some man I knew other than the bar bummers round
here. It's four years since we met, isn't it? And I
owe you that five dollars still; lost your postal
address, or did you give me one?"</p>

<p>Floyd laughed.</p>

<p>He had sailed under Cardon in one of the blackbird
freighters, and knew him for what he was&mdash;one of the
best, most desperate, and irresponsible of men. He
had parted from him at 'Frisco in a bar in a haze of
tobacco smoke, Cardon, relieved of his responsibilities
in life by reason of a quarrel with his owners, sitting
on a high stool by the counter, a full glass beside him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
and leading the chorus of "A Hot Time in the Old
Town To-night."</p>

<p>He was to have seen Cardon the next day, but they
had failed to meet, and then the sea had separated
them. He remembered the five dollars; they fluttered
up to his mind now&mdash;ghosts of silver coins forgotten
beneath the waters of memory.</p>

<p>Cardon was like a sea breeze to him in his present
state of mind, and he followed as Cardon led the
way through a garden where seats and tables were
set out and into a bar where more seats and tables
faced a bar counter gorgeous with colored bottles.</p>

<p>There were island spears and head-dresses on the
walls, and photographs of towns sea-washed and
backed by coconut palms.</p>

<p>The poetry of the islands spreads across the Pacific
even to the bars of Sydney and San Francisco, where
the trade winds blow in mariners bronzed by the sun
and salt, where even the traders carry with them in
their hands something more than copra or gold.</p>

<p>The place was almost empty at this hour, and Cardon,
at Floyd's request, called for soft drinks. Floyd
produced cigars.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cardon, when he had lit up, "I'm
blessed if this doesn't lay over everything. To think
of you and me parting at Black Jack's on the Barbary
Coast four years and more ago and promising to meet
the next day, and then meeting here, just as though
we'd only parted yesterday&mdash;what have you been doing
with yourself?"</p>

<p>"What have you?" asked Floyd. "You tell me your
yarn, and I'll tell mine. I want a little time to think
about mine, for if I'm not mistaken it will have more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
to do with you than you think. I may have an offer
to make you; however, that will do to talk of afterward."</p>

<p>"If your offer has anything to do with money, I'm
open to it," said Cardon. "What have I been doing
since we parted? Everything and nothing. I made
a fortune the next year in Brazil&mdash;mining. And I lost
it six months after I got it. I was done by a partner,
and pretty nigh done up. Then I took to the sea
again. A cattle boat, and I was boss of it. I was
tending the cattle&mdash;fact. But I didn't grumble. I like
cattle; they're a long sight honester than men. Well,
after that I did some railway work in Central America,
and after that I went oil prospecting with a young
fellow who paid for kit and accouterments and died
on my hands with malaria before we got a sign of what
we were looking for. He had no relatives, and he
gave me all the money on him before he died, which
wasn't much&mdash;some seven hundred dollars. Then I
turned up here on the hunt for gold, and found none;
did some more railway work and got good pay for it,
straggled back to Sydney and struck you in the street.
That's all."</p>

<p>"Well, you're looking well on it," said Floyd; "you
don't look a day older than when I met you last."</p>

<p>"Nor I don't feel it," said Cardon. "If I'd been
living in a city all the time it would have been different,
but the open air keeps one alive. If I'd managed to
keep that fortune, I'd have mostlike been dead by this
time between wine and women. As it is, I'm liver
than when I started&mdash;I don't care a hang for money."</p>

<p>"Well, why are you always hunting for it then?"
asked Floyd, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>"For the pleasure of the hunt," replied Cardon.
"What makes a man hunt bears and spend thousands
of dollars on guns and tents and guides, as I've seen
some of these N' York chaps do? He doesn't love
bears; he hunts them for the fun of the thing. Same
with me and dollars; I don't love them, but I love
hunting for them. It's the same with most men, I
reckon. Well, what's your yarn?"</p>

<p>Floyd tipped the ash off his cigar. All this time,
while listening to Cardon, he had been making up his
mind. He, like Cardon, did not love money. He
reckoned that his share of the pearling business and
the pearls, even if he were to divide it equally with
Cardon, would give him enough money to start in
life at some more profitable business than sailoring.
He was bitterly in need of friendship and a strong
man's help, and he decided to tell Cardon everything,
invoke his help, and offer him half shares.</p>

<p>"What I'm going to tell you," said he, "sounds like
a yarn out of a book, but it's the truth. Some months
ago I left 'Frisco, bound for the islands in a schooner
owned by a man named Coxon. The <i>Cormorant</i> was
her name. She was an unlucky ship." He told of the
fire, of the island, of Schumer and Isbel, of the pearls&mdash;he
told everything worth telling about the whole
business; and, when he had finished, the effect of the
yarn on Cardon was very evident, for that gentleman
for once in his life was dumb.</p>

<p>"But that's not all," went on Floyd. "Something
happened yesterday that puts a topknot on the whole
business."</p>

<p>He told of the conversation he had overheard in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
Hakluyt's office, and of the act of treachery which he
believed to be impending.</p>

<p>"That's clear enough," said Cardon; "they mean to
do you up. Who is this Luckman?"</p>

<p>"I don't know him from Adam. Didn't even see
him, only heard his voice."</p>

<p>"That's bad," said Cardon; "and you say the
<i>Southern Cross</i> sails the day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on Thursday."</p>

<p>"You are bound to go in her?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Has Hakluyt said anything to you about Luckman?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>"Yet you are the skipper?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's your crew?"</p>

<p>"All Kanakas."</p>

<p>"All Kanakas?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But how in the nation are you going to work her
single-handed?"</p>

<p>"Oh, easy enough. I have a chap called Mountain
Joe; he's a Kanaka, but he has picked up a bit of navigation."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cardon, "that simplifies matters a bit,
for Hakluyt can't ship this blighter as a Kanaka, can't
slide him aboard as an extra hand. He must ship
him openly; most likely he'll do it at the last moment."</p>

<p>"That is what I'm thinking," said Floyd. "He'll
dump him onto me just as I'm getting up anchor, and
I can't refuse, for he's sure to make up some yarn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
My only course is to take him and then deal with him
when I get to sea."</p>

<p>"That's easier said than done."</p>

<p>"You're right."</p>

<p>"Unless you shoot him right off and chuck him
overboard, which is impossible; or put him in irons,
which, with a Kanaka crew, would be risky; or maroon
him on some rock or other with a beaker of water
and a bag of bread, which is also a bit risky. No, I
should take him right along and front him with this
Schumer, tell them they are found out, and at the
first sign of a move on their part&mdash;shoot."</p>

<p>"That's easy to say."</p>

<p>"Yes, easier to say than do; yet if it was me I'd
do it."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Floyd, "will you come into this
business with me? I'll give you half profits."</p>

<p>Cardon did not reply for a moment. He took a
pull at his drink, wiped his mouth with the back of
his hand, looked at the top of his cigar, and then said,
quite simply:</p>

<p>"I don't mind."</p>

<p>Floyd stretched out his hand and they shook.</p>

<p>"I thought you would," said Floyd. "And now I'll
tell you something else&mdash;it's not the money I'm thinking
of so much as that girl I told you of."</p>

<p>"Isbel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Isbel. I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Soft on her," said Cardon, laughing. "Well,
you're not the first to get tangled with a girl. All the
same, I wish we were fighting this business out without
petticoats in it. I have a holy dread of petticoats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
On shore and after a cruise I don't mind; but they're
no use afloat or where fighting has to be done."</p>

<p>"Aren't they?" said Floyd. "I'd sooner have Isbel
backing me in a row than most men. I told you she
helped me in my scrap with those scamps, but I did
not tell you all. She can shoot straight, and she doesn't
know fear. She backed me right through the business
without turning a hair, and we were fighting half a
day and the whole of a night. Fighting? Yes! I
have never known what it meant before&mdash;shut up in
a house with nearly half a hundred Solomon Islanders
outside all yelling like fiends and mad to have one's
blood."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cardon, "I expect you'll have some
fighting to match that before we have done with this
business. If this man Schumer is anything like what
you say, and if this man Luckman is anything like
Schumer, we will have our work cut out for us by a
fancy tailor. What did you say these pearls were
worth?"</p>

<p>"Worth? I don't know the exact figures, but Schumer
has pearls there on the island now that I reckon
must be at least worth twenty thousand pounds. I'm
figuring on the values he suggested, and he's a man
who knows something of pearls, and he's not a man
who exaggerates."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to halve your pearls," said
Cardon. "I reckon my share in the business will be
the whole of Schumer's."</p>

<p>"Of Schumer's?"</p>

<p>"Of Schumer's."</p>

<p>"But, see here," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>"You intend to take Schumer's share from him?"</p>

<p>"That is what I said."</p>

<p>"But would that be fair? He has worked deuced
hard; he discovered the oyster beds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he betrayed you, and is only waiting there on
this island of yours to help to do you in."</p>

<p>"All the same," said Floyd, "I don't like the idea
of stripping him if we get the better of him. It may
be foolish, but I've worked alongside of him, and,
though I believe he is the biggest scoundrel God ever
put hair on, I don't like the idea of taking his share
of the pearls from him."</p>

<p>"When we have done with Schumer," replied Cardon
grimly, "I don't suspect he'll want pearls. We'll
leave the matter till then, for it's on the cards that
when he has done with us we won't want pearls, either.
So let's not divide the stuff up till the business is over.
How are you off for arms and ammunition?"</p>

<p>"I have a revolver at my rooms and half a packet
of cartridges, and there is a rifle on board in my cabin
with a hundred cartridges for it."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Cardon. "And I have my old friend
Joe." He opened his coat and showed a navy revolver
strapped in its case to his belt. He slipped the
long, beautifully kept weapon from its case and stroked
it lovingly. "This is him. This chap would stop a
hippopotamus. He's a man's weapon&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"He's big enough," said Floyd, as Cardon returned
Joe to his case, "and I hope to goodness we'll pull this
thing through without having to use him. I'm not a
coward, but I hate killing."</p>

<p>"So do I," replied Cardon, "till it comes to the
point. Well, now we've settled about the arms, let's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
fix another matter. How am I to book a passage on
the <i>Southern Cross</i>?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that out the whole time,"
replied Floyd. "Suppose I go to Hakluyt and say
that I have a friend I want to take with me, he'll buck
at the idea at once, the same as if I told him I wanted
an extra hand to help in the navigating; and it would
be quite natural, too, for the whole of this business is
a secret, and if another white man was taken on
board, no matter who or what he was, it might mean
the secret getting out."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Cardon.</p>

<p>"The only way," continued Floyd, "is to take you
without Hakluyt knowing."</p>

<p>"Stowaway?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There are two cabins off the main cabin&mdash;the
captain's and the mate's. Only one is used; for
Mountain Joe, the fellow I told you about, berths with
the crew. I can take you aboard to-morrow night.
I'll tell Joe next morning you have gone ashore in a
shore boat. You can stay in the mate's cabin till we
get the anchor up."</p>

<p>"No," said Cardon, "in your cabin."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>"This way: Suppose old man Hakluyt arrives off
with this Luckman at the last moment. You can't refuse
to take him; you don't <i>want</i> to refuse. Well, naturally,
he'll want the mate's cabin, and you can let
him have it without any bother."</p>

<p>"That's true," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"Luckman may be sprung on you before that," said
Cardon. "In which case we must make some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
arrangement about my getting on board; but, as far
as we know, what we have decided on will stand."</p>

<p>"Where are you staying in Sydney?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cardon, "I only arrived last night, and
I put up at a tavern on the Leicester Road. I left all
my gear there. It isn't much, and it won't take many
porters to fetch it down to the wharfside."</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, "you had better come and stay
at my place. I can get you a room, and you can put
your things among my baggage which I'll send on
board to-morrow night."</p>

<p>Cardon agreed to this, and, finishing their drinks,
they left the place together.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>PETER WILLIAMS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning Floyd called on Hakluyt, while
Cardon, who had accompanied him, waited
outside the office.</p>

<p>Floyd was half an hour in the office, and when he
came out Cardon followed till he had turned the street
corner, and there joined him.</p>

<p>"I can't make it out," said Floyd; "I've said good-by
to him, and I'm to start to-morrow morning at sunup,
and not a word did he say about Luckman or anyone
else, not a hint that he was going to send an extra
hand on board. What's the meaning of it? Did I
dream that business in the office, or was it real?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you'll find it real enough to satisfy
you before long," said Cardon. "You see, there's one
solid reason behind all this that will make it work out
different from a dream, and that reason is pearls.
You say you have a third share in the business, which
share, if the business is worth twenty thousand as it
stands, would work out close on seven thousand
pounds. Now, if Hakluyt is a shipowner, he's a scoundrel;
and if he's a scoundrel, he'll do a lot to secure
seven thousand pounds. Why, men sink ships every day
for less than that; and sinking a ship is a lot more risky
business than doing up an unknown sailorman. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
needn't be uneasy on that score. You dreamed a real
dream. You see, you are worth killing, that's the long
and short of it; for not only are you worth the seven
thousand, but you are worth a third of all that pearl
lagoon will bring in the future, which may be a lot.
I wish we could get to know something about this
Luckman. Suppose we make inquiries?"</p>

<p>"Whom could we ask?"</p>

<p>"Some one who knows the port. Peter Williams,
he's the man; he keeps a bar down on the waterside.
I knew him in Melbourne years ago, and I gave him
a call when I came here first, and he's a friendly sort
of customer. Don't you do any talking; leave it all
to me."</p>

<p>They took their way down to the waterside, and
here, before a rather dingy bar with the name Peter
Williams done in huge letters on the front, Cardon
paused.</p>

<p>"This is the place," said he, "and we'd better go in
separate. You see, if Williams by any chance was to
know Luckman and tell him two strangers had been
inquiring about him, Luckman would ask for a description
of them, and might spot you. Don't pretend to
know me, then we will be on the safe side."</p>

<p>Peter Williams, a red-headed Welshman in shirt
sleeves, was leaning across the bar talking to Cardon
when Floyd entered. There was no one else in the
place.</p>

<p>Floyd glanced round him with disgust. The walls
were dingy and showed a dado of grease marks above
the benches where the heads of customers had rested
against the wall. The atmosphere was heavy with
stale tobacco and the smell of gin and sawdust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>He called for a drink, and took his seat on one of
the benches while Peter Williams returned to his conversation
with Cardon.</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't have him here," said Peter. "Not
that I'm a prying man into another man's character,
for a publican has nothing to do with the character of
his customers. No, it's not that; it's my other customers
I'm thinking of. If he was to come in here or
be seen here regular, I'd lose my trade&mdash;and no wonder.
He's never been had by the law, but he's got the
name of having drowned more sailormen than is good
for him. It's so. He's lost three ships out of this
port alone, and God He knows how many more, and
has done it so artful that the law can't touch him.
And still he gets ships. What's that you say&mdash;you
wonder that sailormen will sign on under him? How
are they to pick and choose? Give them drink enough,
and they'd sign on under Satan. And there's more than
that to it. The <i>Baralong</i>, she was known to be rotten
right down to her garboard strake and Huffer was her
captain, and he was known to be as bad as her; and there
were two jacks in here drinking and talking her over
and talking Huffer over and giving them both their
proper names. Well, next day both those chaps
signed on under Huffer, and the day after they were
off to Valparaiso on the <i>Baralong</i>. I believe some of
those chaps would sooner sign on in a crazy vessel
than a sound one. They seem to like the danger. All
the same, when they sit down to their drinks they
don't want to have the taste of their liquor spoiled
by the sight of chaps like Huffer or Luckman.
They'll sail under them, but they won't drink near
them. That's the plain truth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>Cardon, after a little while, went out, and
presently Floyd followed him.</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, when they met in the street,
"you've heard Luckman's character. What do you
think of it?"</p>

<p>"I never think about men's characters, or bother
a cent about anything than the man himself," replied
Cardon. "A man may have a tremendous big character&mdash;or,
better, call it reputation for being a holy
terror; and when you overhaul him you may find him
to be a merchantman painted in imitation of a pirate,
or, again, he may have the reputation of being
a very quiet man indeed; then you take his lid off, and&mdash;oh,
my!</p>

<p>"I've seen a little bit of a man who looked like a
parson with the pip, a little bit of a chap with a pale
face that looked as if it had been trying all its life
to raise a beard and then given up the business as unworkable.
Well, that chap swam out to a ship
somewhere down the Chile coast, talked the crew over,
and made them mutiny. With the crew he took
the ship, and with the ship he took a town, and with
the town he'd have taken Chile, I believe, only the
Chilean government chipped in in time and sent
troops and beat him in a big battle near Valdivia
and then hanged him at Concepci&oacute;n. I saw him
hanged. Benken was his name&mdash;an American from
nowhere, with a past history that showed nothing except
the fact that he had once been a prisoner in
Numea and had escaped by raising a revolt and murdering
the guards. Yet to look at him he was quite
a quiet man; might have been a shopman.</p>

<p>"No; as I was saying, there's nothing counts but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the man himself, and by the man himself I don't mean
a man's character or face, but just the something that
drives him on. If he hasn't got that something, he
may have the face of a Napoleon Bonaparte or the
character of a white lamb&mdash;it doesn't matter, he
arrives nowhere. Now, from all accounts, the man I
fear most in this business is not Luckman but
Schumer. Schumer seems to be all there from what you
tell me, and he doesn't seem to make much show. Is
he a quiet sort of chap?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"Fair spoken and easy in his talk?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's the sort of man that gives trouble. Well,
we will see what we will see when the time comes;
and now I propose we go and have a bit of dinner.
It's the last we'll have on shore for some time."</p>

<p>That afternoon Floyd, having paid off his
landlord, called a porter and had his gear, together with
Cardon's, taken down to the wharfside. Here they
took a shore boat and rowed off to the <i>Southern
Cross</i>. Mountain Joe was hanging over the rail as
they approached. He and the whole Kanaka ship's
company had been specially provided for when on
shore by Hakluyt. He had sent the whole lot, in
fact, under the guidance of one of his men, to a
fishing village down the coast, there to amuse themselves
till the time of sailing. He did not want them
knocking round Sydney and maybe talking, though indeed
they knew little enough as to the truth concerning the
pearl fishery.</p>

<p>Mountain Joe grinned when he saw Floyd; then
he lowered the ladder for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>It was a lovely late afternoon, the great harbor
like a sheet of glass, the gulls crying and wheeling
above the water and the trees of the shore and the
far-stretching hills green against a sky of summer.
Cardon, when he stepped on deck, looked round him
with approval. The <i>Southern Cross</i> was not a fast
boat, as schooners go, but she was only some six years
old and she had been well looked after. Built by
McDowell, of Sydney, than whom no better schooner
builder exists, she had been laid down to the plans of
a private firm with ideas of their own, as though one
were to go to Mr. Pool or Messrs. Stultz for a suit
of clothes to be made according to one's own ideas
of cut and style.</p>

<p>The result was that the <i>Southern Cross</i> turned out
to be something of a failure as far as speed was
concerned, but a splendid sea boat. Every bit of stuff in
her was good, and spars, rigging, and hull would have
stood the criticism of an English navy dockyard
inspection.</p>

<p>Floyd took Cardon down below and showed him
the main cabin and the cabins of the captain and the
first and second mate.</p>

<p>The captain's cabin had two bunks&mdash;an upper and
a lower one&mdash;and they arranged that Cardon should
sleep that night in the upper bunk, which had
curtains.</p>

<p>"If Hakluyt should turn up before we start," said
Cardon, "I can lie in the upper bunk with the curtains
drawn and you can say I'm some of your gear you
have stowed there. There's no fear of any of those
tomfool Kanakas coming and poking their noses in
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>"No, I'll look to that. The fellow that acts as
steward is a born fool, and if he did see you he
wouldn't take notice; and, anyhow, you're on board,
and, Hakluyt or no Hakluyt, you are going to sail
with me."</p>

<p>He got out the spirits and some cigars, and they
sat smoking and talking till the steward came in to
light the lamps.</p>

<p>Cardon, at sight of this person, felt no uneasiness;
he was of the stupid type of native&mdash;"wore his mouth
open," to use Cardon's expression, and was afflicted
with deafness due to adenoids.</p>

<p>They came up on deck after dark, and sat smoking
and watching the lights of Sydney and the harbor all
spangled with star reflections and the anchor lights
of the shipping.</p>

<p>"Well," said Cardon, "if old man Hakluyt had
been intending to come off for the purpose of dumping
Luckman on you, I guess he'd have come by this."</p>

<p>"You never know," replied Floyd. "That sort of
reptile is pretty cunning, and I don't give up a fear
of surprise till I'm outside the Heads. Look!
There's a shore boat come off, and it's making for us
if I'm not mistaken."</p>

<p>Cardon looked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"You're right," said he.</p>

<p>Without another word he turned and dived below.</p>

<p>Floyd, quite sure as to the other's ability to take
cover, remained on deck.</p>

<p>He could see the boat now clearly as she drew
near across the starlit water.</p>

<p>There were four fellows rowing, and a figure in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
stern steering. It was Hakluyt alone and
unaccompanied by Luckman.</p>

<p>Hakluyt came on board and gave Floyd good
evening, inquired if the crew were all right, and then came
below.</p>

<p>Floyd, who preceded him, looked anxiously round,
but Cardon had removed all traces of himself, and
the door of the captain's cabin was closed.</p>

<p>"Well," said Hakluyt, as he took his seat and a
drink, "here's luck to the voyage and a quick return
with another cargo of shell, though I expect it is
Schumer himself who will come next to Sydney. You will
give him my very good respects?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Floyd, "and perhaps the next
time I meet you will be on the island. You are sure
to pay us another visit."</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied Hakluyt, "and maybe not. I am
getting old for sea work, but I shall always be glad
to welcome you in Sydney."</p>

<p>He produced a pocketbook, and they went into
accounts as to stores, et cetera. This business took
them some half hour or so, and then Hakluyt took
another cigar and talked on indifferent subjects till it
was time to go.</p>

<p>He shook hands effusively with Floyd on deck, and
wished him good luck again as he went down the side.</p>

<p>Floyd watched the boat draw off and the oars
making rings on the star-spangled water; then he returned
to the cabin, where he found Cardon released from
his prison and seated at the table.</p>

<p>"He's gone," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"And no sign of Luckman?"</p>

<p>"Not a sign."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>"Well," said Cardon, "it's beyond me. However,
we're not out of Sydney harbor yet, and there's no
knowing what may happen before we are."</p>

<small>THE OPEN SEA</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Floyd</span> did not take the trouble to speak to
Mountain Joe about Cardon's presence on board.</p>

<p>Cardon got into the upper bunk at about eleven
o'clock and went promptly to sleep. As for Floyd,
he could neither sleep nor lie still. During his stay
in Sydney, he had been restless enough at times, but
he had never felt like this. Ever since his departure
from the island the idea of Isbel had followed him
and been with him now clear and close, now more
remote and partly obscured from him by everyday
affairs.</p>

<p>To-night she haunted him.</p>

<p>All sorts of fears and imaginings rose in his mind.
He had never known the extent of his love for her
till just this moment, on the eve of his return. Suppose
when he got back he found she was not there.
Suppose the natives had revolted again; suppose that
Schumer, playing every one false and on the chance
of a passing ship, had gone off from the island, taking
the pearls with him and Isbel. Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;&mdash;There
was no end to the suppositions that
rose up before his mind as he paced the floor of the
main cabin and listened to Cardon snoring in his bunk.</p>

<p>Cardon, in his idea of passing himself off as bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>gage,
had not reckoned on his capacity for snoring.
Floyd, however, did not trouble about it; even if Hakluyt
were suddenly to come on board and see Cardon
in the flesh, let alone hearing him snoring, it would
not much matter.</p>

<p>In his present frame of mind, he would have bundled
Hakluyt down the main hatch and closed it on
him had he appeared to give any trouble.</p>

<p>He came on deck, leaving Cardon to his dreams,
and paced the planks, still engaged in suppositions as
to Isbel.</p>

<p>Then the night wind, balmy and warm, blew the
evil fancies from his mind and restored its tone.
Nothing could have happened in the few weeks that
had elapsed since his departure. Isbel was well able
to take care of herself, and as for the natives, they
were not likely to try any more tricks with Sru dead
and Schumer in command. The real danger was to
come, and its name was Luckman. That was nothing.
With Cardon at his elbow, he felt able to cope
with a hundred Luckmans and Schumers. He was
forewarned. Fate had declared for him&mdash;or so it
seemed.</p>

<p>He remained on deck till dawn began to break
upon the harbor, then he went down and woke Cardon.</p>

<p>Before going down, he had stirred up the cook
and ordered coffee to be sent to the main cabin; and
while they were drinking this they heard a boat coming
alongside, and Mountain Joe shouted down the
hatchway that the pilot was coming on board.</p>

<p>"I reckon I'd better stay hid till we are clear of the
harbor," said Cardon. "There's no use in running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
risks. Up with you, and interview the pilot and get
the anchor out of the mud as quick as you can. Give
me a word when you have dropped him. You won't
have far to look for me."</p>

<p>Floyd went up and found the pilot already on
deck. The wind was fair; all the port regulations
had been complied with, and there was nothing to
hold them but the anchor.</p>

<p>Cardon, down below, could hear the clank of the
windlass pawls as the slack of the anchor chain was
being hove in, the feet of the fellows on deck running
to orders, their voices as they hauled on the halyards,
and then again the welcome music of the pawls
as the anchor was dragged from the mud and hauled,
gray and dripping, to the catheads.</p>

<p>Instantly the schooner took the feel of a live ship,
to use Cardon's words. She heeled ever so little, and,
as he lay in the bunk, he could hear the warble of the
water against her planking, to say nothing of the rattle
of the rudder chain and the occasional creak of
woodwork acknowledging mast pressure and strain.</p>

<p>After a while Cardon, tired with the stuffy air of
the cabin, dropped asleep. When he awoke, Floyd
was standing beside him, and by the movement of the
cabin he knew that the <i>Southern Cross</i> had cleared the
harbor and was making her bow to the Pacific.</p>

<p>"How about the pilot?" asked Cardon, rubbing
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Dropped him long ago," replied Floyd. "Hop
out and come on deck. The fellow is laying the things
for breakfast, and a breath of air will do you good."</p>

<p>Cardon slipped from the bunk and came on deck.</p>

<p>A brave breeze was blowing, and the sea, roughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
up beneath the morning sun, had a hard, gemlike look.
Foam caps showed, and in the west the setting moon
hung, ghostlike, in a sky that suggested millions and
millions of miles of depth and blueness.</p>

<p>All the east was hard and bright; all the west was
blue and subtle and tender; and between the east and
the west lay the sea like a country carved from sapphire
and tourmaline, with the green hills of earth
sinking slowly but surely away beyond the foam in
the schooner's wake.</p>

<p>Then, as the sun mounted higher, the sea lost its
look of solidity, cast it back on the land, now remote
and hard, black fish came walloping along as if racing
the rushing schooner. The wind, freshening, blew in
great, steady gusts, filling the bellying canvas and
pressing like a great hand so that the lee rail was
almost awash and the spray came inboard, fresh, like
the very breath of the sea.</p>

<p>Cardon, with his hand on the ratlines, stood taking
it all in while Floyd stood beside him, his clothes flapping
round him in the flogging wind.</p>

<p>Mountain Joe was at the wheel. He showed no
surprise at Cardon's presence on board, nor did any
of the others. They evidently looked on him as a
passenger or supercargo of some sort approved of
by Hakluyt.</p>

<p>"She's a good sea boat," said Cardon, "and she
seems to steer well; but what in the nation can have
become of Luckman?"</p>

<p>"That's what's bothering me," said Floyd. "I've
been trying to figure the thing out ever since we got
the anchor on board. He can't be stowed away anywhere.
He's not in the fo'c'sle, for I went down there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
under the pretense of seeing whether the hammocks
were all right. He's not in the galley, he's not in the
cabins, and he's not in the hold. He's not on board,
in fact. Well, what is the meaning of it? The only
thing I can imagine is that the affair has fallen
through and he's gone off with the money Hakluyt
gave him&mdash;either that or I must have imagined the
conversation I heard."</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon that wasn't any imagination of
yours," said Cardon. "There was lots of reason why
Hakluyt should have put the business against you.
No; the only explanation is that the thing, as you say,
must have fallen through. Luckman funked it and
took his hook with the money. That's the only possible
thing that can have happened. But it leaves the
position just the same as far as you and I are concerned."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just this: The plot was made against you, and
it wasn't made in Sydney. It was all arranged on the
island between Schumer and Hakluyt."</p>

<p>"Yes, it must have been."</p>

<p>"Well, then, the question turns up, are you going to
go on working with this Schumer, who has made all
the arrangements for doing you in and who would
have done you in had not the thing fallen through?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said Floyd. "I have finished with Schumer."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you haven't!" replied Cardon. "Not by
a long chalk. There remains the question of the
pearls, and the question of punishment. Schumer has
got to pay for his villainy, and pay through the nose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
But there's the fellow bringing breakfast aft. Let's
go down, and we can talk the matter out below."</p>

<p>They went down, and when breakfast was over
Cardon lit a pipe, settled himself comfortably on the
couch at the starboard side of the cabin, and, after a
moment's silence, turned to Floyd, who was lighting a
cigar.</p>

<p>"You have got to get even with Schumer, and from
all you have told me of Schumer you will have your
work cut out. I know the type. The Pacific is full
of it. This chap is a trader and a sailor and a fighter
all rolled in one. I know the sort&mdash;able to do anything,
from playing a tune on a fiddle to playing a
dirty trick. I know them."</p>

<p>"Don't you be too sure," said Floyd. "This man
Schumer is not one of the ordinary sort of traders
and swindlers. He's a very big man. He ought to
have been anything, and the wonder to me is he has
never risen to something in the world better than
what he is."</p>

<p>"There you have his weakness," said Cardon. "I
admit he may be a big man, as you say; and yet, as
you say, he is only a little one as far as the world is
concerned. There's something wrong somewhere in
his make-up. He doesn't drink?"</p>

<p>"Not he!"</p>

<p>"Well, there's some crack in him we must try and
feel for. I expect the chap is such a rightdown wrong
one that he has failed in life just because of that. I
don't say I'm not a failure in my way, but I have
failed mostly through taking things easy and trusting
in men. But Schumer hasn't those weaknesses, if I
can judge by what you have told me. No; I suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
his disease has been a pretty general one. He's a
wrong un. I'm not a man given to moralizing, but
I've seen a lot of the world, and I've seen that men
who don't run straight don't get on. It's funny, but
they don't. Now look at old man Schumer's case.
He fell in with a pearl lagoon; he has taken twenty
thousand pounds' worth of pearls out of it, and maybe
more by this. He had a partner named Floyd. He
couldn't run straight with that partner, but must lay
plans for his wiping out. Floyd discovers his trick,
and now Schumer is going to lose pearls and lagoon
and all; and when he's lost them he will go back to his
old way of life with his feathers clipped, and men will
say: 'I can't understand that Schumer; he ought to
have been anything, and yet there he is bumming
around in bars.' That's what they will say. Honesty
is the best policy, and that's God's truth and no copybook
story, and that's what I'm going to teach Schumer."</p>

<p>"But, look here, you say he is going to lose pearls
and lagoon and all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I? He may keep the lagoon&mdash;we only want the
pearls."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to say&mdash;we have to
get them before we keep them. I know. The thing
to worry out is how we are to get the weather gauge
on him. You have taken me into this affair as a partner,
offering me half your share. I don't want that.
I want Schumer's share. The man is a murderer, and
deserves hanging. I am only going to fire him, but I
admit the thing will be difficult.</p>

<p>"If we sail into the lagoon and declare war openly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
with him, he'll fight, and he'll be backed by all those
natives he has got there."</p>

<p>"He will, and besides there's the&mdash;the girl."</p>

<p>"Just so; you don't want her injured."</p>

<p>"Cardon," said Floyd, "I tell you the truth as
between man and man. She's everything. I don't care
a straw about the pearls, about money, about Schumer.
I don't care about life itself where she's concerned.
She's the only thing I have ever cared for
really."</p>

<p>"And yet," cut in Cardon, "if you care for her like
that, it's all the more important for you not to be
done out over the pearls. Pearls are money. Well,
do you think you don't want money? To a single man,
money is useful, but to a man with a woman in tow,
by God, it's a blank necessity! What are you to do
with her as a sailor? Leave her in some seaport while
you are off sweeping the sea for tuppence a week in
some dirty hooker owned by some dirty owner who
feeds his men on salt horse and sends them to the
bottom through overloading or for the sake of the
insurance money? No. If you care for a woman,
put a pistol to her head before you turn her into a
sailor's wife, depending on a sailor's pay. You have
got to get the money that's owing to you from Schumer,
and you have got to get your satisfaction from
him. I don't know how yet, but I'll find out by thinking
over it."</p>

<p>"You are right," said Floyd. "I have got to get
the money, anyhow, even if I don't get the satisfaction.
But there's another point: Suppose I do get
the pearls; there's always a difficulty in selling them."</p>

<p>"You needn't worry about that," said Cardon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
"I've got the means of selling anything that is come
by honestly. I have a good name among a good set
at 'Frisco. Now I'll tell you something you can't
easily believe; but if I wanted to borrow money in
'Frisco, I could do so to the extent of thousands and
thousands of dollars. There are two men there, rich
men, who would let me draw on them for what I
liked; and yet I have often borrowed a few dollars
from a poor man&mdash;you remember that five dollars I
got from you and which I owe you still, by the way.
No, sir, I have never tapped those rich men because
they are under an obligation to me, and because they
are my friends, and because I know that they would
be only too pleased to lend to me. Men are funny
things, and I guess I'm a man. Anyhow, that's how
things stand. Now, if I were to go to those men and
say: 'Look here, I have got a fortune in pearls, and
I want to turn it into dollars,' those fellows would
put all their means at my disposal to get me the best
price, and ten to one they'd buy the stuff themselves,
and my difficulty would be to stop them from paying
too big a price. One is Kane, of the Union Pacific
Company; the other is Calthorpe, the grain man. I
knew them first twenty years ago, when we were all
dead beats together. Kane started life as a newsboy,
selling books on the cars of the Reading Railway.
He builds them now. Calthorpe started in life on the
docks at 'Frisco, helping to load sacks of wheat.
They don't load wheat in sacks nowadays; his elevators
do most of the work. Well, they are white
men, and though they have wives and daughters and
carriages, they are always glad to see me at their
offices, and they are such gentlemen they have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
offered to start me in life. They take me as one of
themselves, and we have a clack and a smoke and a
drink. I generally stand the drinks, and I know they
are green with envy of my stomach, for they are both
eaten up with dyspepsia. Now those chaps have succeeded
in life, but they haven't succeeded in keeping
up their pleasure in life. I have, and I reckon, when
all's said and done, the account is on my side. They
are pretty well done to death with worry, living in
stuffed-up rooms, fighting every moment of the day to
keep what they've got, taking their food like medicine,
and with gold teeth in their heads to help them
chew it; and here am I with every tooth in my head
and an appetite like a shark, clear two hundred, without
an ache or pain, breathing God's good air, and
sailing to belt a chap over the head and collar a pearl
lagoon. I guess they'd change places if their wives
would let them."</p>

<p>"You have never grown old," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"I'm forty-five," replied Cardon, "and I don't
want to grow any older, and I wouldn't be an inch
younger for worlds. A man only begins to live properly
when he's forty, and at forty-five he has just
about found himself. Well, I'm going on deck to
have a breath of air. She seems to be going a bit
steadier; I expect the wind has fallen."</p>

<p>When they got on deck, they found that the wind
had lost its gusty character and had settled down into
a steady blow. The land was very far away, and only
one sail was in sight&mdash;a full-rigged ship, almost hull
down on the horizon and white like a flake of spar.
The <i>Southern Cross</i> was heading northeast, on a
course that would leave Norfolk Island some two hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>dred
miles to port; and before her lay that great,
empty zone of sea which stretches from the Kermadec
Islands to the Tongas, and from the Australs to the
Isle of Pines.</p>

<p>Some ten days out from Sydney, they hailed a
steamer; she was the mail boat from Auckland to Fiji,
and the last trace of her smoke was the last sign of
man for many days.</p>

<p>The weather was perfect and the wind favorable,
though moderate, as they stole northward toward the
line. Each day the sea became of a deeper and
deeper blue, and each day the sense of remoteness
from the world as we know it grew more intense.</p>

<p>The nights were tremendous with stars, and the
days were scarcely days, as days are reckoned with us.
They left on the mind only one enduring impression&mdash;great
spaces of radiant blueness, infinite distance
where there was nothing but the send of the sea and
the blowing of a tepid wind.</p>

<p>One day, breaking the sea line on the starboard
bow, came an island&mdash;a dream of the sea, foam-stained
and waving palms to the wind, the tepid wind
still blowing steadily and ceaselessly like the moist,
warm breath of million-leagued Capricorn. It was
Rarotonga.</p>

<p>It faded away, and at sunset it had vanished. Next
day, toward noon, the Hervey Islands showed right
ahead, and, like a white gull coming from the islands
toward them, a schooner. She passed only a few
cable lengths away, her canvas luminous and honey-colored
with the sun. She was a trader bound for the
Tongas, and in an hour she was a speck to the southward,
while the Hervey Islands loomed more fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
ahead, only to be passed with the sunset and wiped
away utterly by the night.</p>

<p>One evening Floyd, who had been working out the
reckoning, said to Cardon:</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if this wind holds good, we ought to
arrive&mdash;somewhere about noon, I should say."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Cardon. "And now I'll tell you of
the plan that's been in my head for the last couple of
days. We have no longer to reckon with Luckman;
he has evidently miscarried. Still, Schumer will give
us all the work we want. My plan is this, and it's
simple enough. When we drop anchor, he's almost
sure to come on board. Well, you must receive him
on deck and ask him down into the main cabin. I'll
be ambushed in your cabin.</p>

<p>"Out I'll step, put Joe's muzzle to his head, and
say, 'Hands up!' When he's disarmed, we'll give him
a fair hearing and a fair trial; you'll be judge, and
I'll be jury. Then we'll lock him up in your cabin to
pray for his sins, and I'll keep watch on him while
you go ashore and collect the pearls and the girl.</p>

<p>"You'll bring them off, and then we'll put to sea.
Outside the reef we'll put Schumer in a boat and let
him row ashore. Then we'll upstick back to Sydney,
and there you and I will have an interview with Hakluyt,
fling Luckman and all that business in his teeth,
and gag him with it. Then we'll make for 'Frisco by
the mail boat. You see, we must take the schooner
back to Sydney, or else be had, maybe, for stealing
her. Well, what do you think of the plan?"</p>

<p>Floyd was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, "Schumer doesn't put his hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
up when you tell him. Suppose he goes for his revolver?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll shoot."</p>

<p>"Suppose he comes on board with half a dozen of
those natives and brings them armed? It's not likely,
but Schumer is just the man to do an unlikely thing
of that sort."</p>

<p>"If we see him coming off with a boatload of those
scalawags, we must change our plan. I can hide till
we are able to get him onto the schooner alone; but
there's no use supposing too much. What we want
is a plan to go on, and that's the best I can think of."</p>

<p>"Well," said Floyd, "I don't like it, and that's the
truth. It's a good enough plan, no doubt, but there
seems to me something treacherous about it. I don't
mean that in a nasty way, or as reflecting on you. All
the same, it's a plan I'd hate to carry out."</p>

<p>"Well, and who forces us to use treachery, as you
call it? If you hide behind a bush to shoot a tiger, is
that treachery? No, it would be if you were dealing
with a man; it isn't if you are dealing with a tiger.
Schumer is a tiger; or, more like, a polecat; and if
you don't use treachery, he will. He has already, in
fact."</p>

<p>"He'd still have the lagoon," said Floyd, wavering.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'd leave him the lagoon&mdash;not for love, but
for our own sakes. I've been figuring the thing out,
and we'd better let the lagoon go. If we tried to
cling to it, we would have to tear Schumer's claws
loose from it, not to speak of Hakluyt's. If we leave
it to them, it will be a sop in the pan and will stop
them from making any worry. We only want the
pearls already captured. They'll do for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>Floyd heaved a sigh. He could not but see the
force of Cardon's reasoning. Schumer deserved punishment,
beyond all question; he had plotted with
Hakluyt, and the plot had only failed to materialize
owing to some accident or some rascality on the part
of Luckman toward his fellow conspirators. Still, he
hated the idea of the whole business. Inveigling a
man into the cabin and then clapping a pistol to his
head was a plan of action that would never have
occurred to him. Cardon was thicker skinned. All
the same, he could not help feeling that Cardon was
right.</p>

<p>There are some men whom it is impossible to deal
with as gentlemen, just as there are some men
whom it is impossible to fight with according to the
rules of the prize ring. Schumer was one of them.</p>

<p>Floyd thought the matter over for a moment, and
came to the conclusion that Cardon was right. "I
have no right to criticize your plan," he answered,
"since I haven't any plan of my own to offer instead
of it. We'll leave it at that, and trust to luck, and if
it comes to doing what you say, I will, of course, back
you, unless I hit on any idea between this and to-morrow."</p>

<p>He went on deck. The <i>Southern Cross</i>, carrying
every stitch of her canvas, was making a good ten
knots, and the foam in her wake had a phosphorescence
as though she were leaving behind her a cloud
of luminous smoke that clung to the water and refused
to rise. Never had he seen the stars more
wonderful, or a night more lovely. There was little
of the heaviness and languor of the tropics; and but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
for Canopus and the Cross blazing overhead it might
have been a night of June in northern latitudes.</p>

<p>Floyd stood by the fellow at the wheel for a little
while, and then he walked forward, and, leaning
against the lee rail, looked over the sea. From the
fo'c'sle came the sound of a concertina, faint and indistinct;
that and the creak of cordage and the slashing
of the bow wash were the only sounds in all that
infinity of night and silence.</p>

<p>He was thinking of Isbel and the island invisible,
but surely there beyond the rim of the sea. There
were moments when the whole thing seemed a fantastic
dream&mdash;Schumer, and the pearls, and the island,
and the woman he loved. Was it possible that he
would see her on the morrow?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>THE ISLAND</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning early, Floyd was on deck and
aloft with a glass. He knew it was impossible,
at their rate of sailing, that the island could show
up before noon. They might not even sight it before
sundown. Yet, all the same, he was on the lookout.
There was nothing; nothing but the great wheel of
the sea. Not even a gull showed in the whole of that
blue expanse.</p>

<p>He came down, disappointed, and was gloomy and
absent-minded at breakfast, though Cardon was
cheerful enough.</p>

<p>Toward eleven o'clock, when they were on deck
smoking and talking, a great bird passed them, flying
straight ahead.</p>

<p>"That chap is going twenty knots," said Cardon.
"I reckon he could make forty if he wanted to. He's
not much of an indication that there's land about, for
a thousand miles to him is less than a thirty-mile walk
to you or me. Say, Floyd, how would it be if we
couldn't find your island? I heard a yarn once of a
chap who spotted a guano island. He said it was a
solid slab of guano a mile wide, and he started for
'Frisco and got up a syndicate to work it, and they
chartered a schooner and had a champagne breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
to start on; and when they reached the spot, the
darned thing had gone&mdash;sunk into the sea."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Floyd. "And I wish you wouldn't
start those sorts of yarns just now; it's not lucky."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am only joking. Your island is there, safe
enough, with Schumer on top of it. That sort of
chap never sinks into the sea; it's only the good men
Davy Jones troubles about. He's a mascot, sure."</p>

<p>Floyd did not answer him; he was staring right
ahead.</p>

<p>"When I sighted it first," said he, "I was in an
open boat that gave very little horizon, and what
struck me first was the sky. It was pale, just a patch
of it, a sort of glittering paleness that was caused by
the lagoon. Have you ever seen that mark in the sky
above a lagoon island?"</p>

<p>"Can't say I have, but then I'm not so used to the
Pacific as you are. Do you see anything now?"</p>

<p>"No," said Floyd. "I wish I did."</p>

<p>Cardon whistled gently to himself, tapping the
ashes out of his pipe against the rail and refilling it.
He was just as anxious as Floyd, but his anxiety had
not such a keen edge and he hid it better. There
were times when he, like Floyd, almost doubted the
reality of the island.</p>

<p>He was bending in the shelter of the bulwark to
light his pipe when a hail came from aloft.</p>

<p>Floyd had stationed a lookout in the crosstrees, and
it was his voice that came, high and clear, like the call
of a bird.</p>

<p>Next moment the two men were swarming up the
ratlines and looking forward in the direction to which
the fellow was pointing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>"It's the island!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>Cardon looked.</p>

<p>All he could see at first was a tiny mark on the sea
line, a mark no larger than a pin head; then, as his
eyes grew more accustomed to the dazzle, another
tiny mark appeared close to the first, and then another.</p>

<p>Then these marks became fused together, forming
a faint line.</p>

<p>The lookout had a glass with him, and Floyd, taking
it, found that it gave scarcely any better definition
than the naked eye. The shimmer of the sea formed
a veil more impenetrable than the veil of distance.</p>

<p>He handed the glass to Cardon, who was clinging
to the ratlines below him.</p>

<p>"It's land, sure enough," said Cardon, "and another
hour will bring it right up. We'd better go
down and wait on deck; no use sticking here."</p>

<p>In less than an hour the palm tops showed clearly
through the glass, and in two hours' time the reef
could be made out and the white thread of the foam
breaking upon it.</p>

<p>It was the island, surely enough, though still a
great way off&mdash;so far that from the deck and with
the naked eye nothing could be seen but a faint smudge
that might have been a trace of smoke clinging to the
sea line.</p>

<p>The wind had fallen a bit, and now, as if beneath
the weight of afternoon, it was falling still more.</p>

<p>Floyd hove the log. They were making seven
knots, and he calculated that it would be sundown
before they could make the break in the reef.</p>

<p>Dinner was served, but they could scarcely eat; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
weather held all their thoughts, and the dread of the
wind falling to a flat calm was on both their minds.</p>

<p>At four o'clock, however, the wind was still steady,
and the land ahead was visible now clearly from the
deck.</p>

<p>Floyd, who had gone aloft, suddenly hailed Cardon,
who was on deck, and the latter came up to him.</p>

<p>"Look out and tell me what you see," said Floyd,
handing him the glass he had been using.</p>

<p>Cardon looked through the glass.</p>

<p>"By gad," said he, "there's a vessel in the lagoon."</p>

<p>The glass showed the reef and the grove on the
right of the break distinctly. The break in the reef
was not so clear, as they were heading slightly to the
south of it; but very clearly indeed could be seen the
threadlike masts of a vessel anchored in the lagoon.
She was stripped of canvas. She was a schooner.</p>

<p>Cardon handed the glass up again to Floyd, who
took another long look; then the two men came down
on deck.</p>

<p>"That's Luckman!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>"'Pears so," said Cardon, "unless it's some vessel
blown in by chance."</p>

<p>"No, it's no chance. I feel convinced of that. He
started ahead of us, and maybe laid over us in sailing.
Let's go down below and have a talk over this."</p>

<p>They went down to the cabin, and Floyd took his
seat at the table while Cardon took the couch.</p>

<p>"You see, it explains everything," said Floyd. "Explains
why Luckman did not sail with us, and why
Hakluyt looked so cheerful, which he wouldn't have
done had his plans fallen through."</p>

<p>"If what you say is right," said Cardon, "it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
everything a lot worse, for why should these scoundrels
employ two ships unless they are determined to
lose one of them? You may bet the <i>Southern Cross</i>
is insured to the hilt and over. You say Hakluyt had
her into dry dock and spent money having her scraped
when she did not want it. That was all part of the
plan to allay suspicion, for what would the ordinary
fool say but that a man wouldn't spend money like
that on a ship he was going to lose."</p>

<p>"Besides," said Floyd, "if Hakluyt had sent Luckman
with me, what reason could he have given me
for sending him? We don't want another white man
in this business&mdash;well, what excuse could Hakluyt have
given me for shoving Luckman in?"</p>

<p>"None," said Cardon, "that I can see; but that's not
saying a clever rascal like Hakluyt couldn't have found
some excuse."</p>

<p>Floyd suddenly struck the table with his fist.</p>

<p>"The <i>Domain</i> wasn't at her anchorage when we
left," said he. "I noticed it, but I never thought of
it as being connected with us."</p>

<p>"The <i>Domain</i>? What vessel was she?"</p>

<p>"One of Hakluyt's, a schooner. She was pointed
out to me as belonging to him, and before we started
I noticed that she wasn't at her anchorage. I thought
nothing of that, for a shipowner doesn't keep ships
to anchor them out and leave them to rot. But there's
the fact, and I'll bet my life that schooner in the lagoon
is the <i>Domain</i>."</p>

<p>"You're probably right," said Cardon. "Anyhow,
we'll soon see. Now let's talk of my share in the
business. If Luckman is really here, it means that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
your destruction has been plotted and planned to the
last tip end. It means that there must be no quarter
for Schumer."</p>

<p>"If Luckman is here," said Floyd, rising and pacing
the cabin, "Schumer will get no quarter from me.
Not a ha'porth of mercy."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are beginning to see things in their
proper light," said Cardon. "And now to business.
I must keep hidden; I can stay in your cabin, and you
must get these two fellows on board as quick as possible.
It may be that Schumer will board us right away
when we get into the lagoon. He's almost sure to.
It may be that he will bring Luckman with him. Now
I think the best plan, if Schumer boards us right off
and by himself, is to deal with him at once, lock him
up here, and then land and deal with Luckman."</p>

<p>"Maybe you are right," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I am. There's nothing like grasping
your nettle right off, and it will give them no time to
conspire together. Of course, if they both come
aboard, so much the better. You speak to them fair,
and bring them down here, get them seated at the
table before some drink; then I'll open the cabin door
and enter, smiling. Directly you see me, draw your
gun and cover one of them. Cover Luckman; that
will be pleasanter for you, seeing that Schumer is
known to you and was once your friend&mdash;or pretended
to be. When we have disarmed them, we will
tie them up."</p>

<p>"Suppose they succeed in drawing their pistols?"</p>

<p>"In that case we must shoot first, and shoot to kill.
There's no use in putting on kid gloves in this matter.
Your life has been planned against; these two chaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
are out against you, and they've got to be scotched.
Do you feel equal to the job? If not, we had better
'bout ship and make back to Sydney."</p>

<p>"God help me," said Floyd, "but what I would
have shuddered at a few days ago leaves me now without
the least feeling. It's finding Luckman here, I
suppose, finding that the plot against me is absolutely
true. I don't know. But the idea of killing those men
seems no more to me than the idea of killing a pair of
scorpions."</p>

<p>"That's right," said Cardon. "You'll do all right.
And now up with you on deck&mdash;I don't appear till the
business begins. If I were to go on deck now, there's
no knowing that I mightn't be spotted through a glass.
Give me your fist."</p>

<p>The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>Then Floyd went on deck, where the hands were
crowded forward, gazing at the island, which was
now so close that the individual trees could be distinguished,
the coral, and the surf breaking on the
outer beach.</p>

<p>Floyd's heart leaped in him at the sight. He took
the glass from its sling near the wheel and examined
the shore through it. Not a sign of life could be
seen.</p>

<p>The house was, of course, hidden by the grove, and
it was quite unlikely that any one might be here on
the seaward side of the reef; still, the absence of all
signs of life struck a chill to the heart of Floyd, the
illogical heart of the man who loves.</p>

<p>The wind was still holding steady, and the <i>Southern
Cross</i> was making good way.</p>

<p>Now they were so close that he fancied he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
hear the tune of the surf on the coral; and now they
were opening the break of the reef, and the lagoon
showed mirror calm as compared to the sea.</p>

<p>Floyd took the wheel.</p>

<p>The schooner held for a moment on her course;
then, answering to the helm, made full for the opening
in the reef. The tide was with them, and like a
white cloud the <i>Southern Cross</i> passed the pierheads
of the reef and entered the lagoon.</p>

<p>Floyd handed the wheel over to Mountain Joe,
gave his orders to the fellows at the halyards and the
braces, and walked forward. There was, indeed, another
vessel in the lagoon, and she was the <i>Domain</i>.
He could not be mistaken. She was anchored a good
way out from the shore, and he maneuvered to get
the inner berth. Even as he did so, his eye caught
sight of a figure that had just emerged from the
grove. It was Isbel.</p>

<p>He ran to the bulwark rail and flung up his arm
just as the roar of the anchor chain through the hawse
pipe cut the air. Isbel waved her hand in reply. She
was alone. Not a sign of Schumer or Luckman was
to be seen, and Floyd, half mad with delight, started
orders for the quarter boat to be lowered, and helped
with his own hands at the falls.</p>

<p>When the boat touched the beach he sprang out
knee-deep in the water, waded ashore, and caught
her two hands in his.</p>

<p>Then he remembered the fellows in the boat and
the possibility that Schumer might be watching from
some post of observation. He released her hands and
led the way up to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>"Schumer?" said he. "Where is Schumer?"</p>

<p>Isbel nodded toward the fishing camp.</p>

<p>"Over there," said she; "he and the new man.
They will only know that you have come now. I saw
you very far at sea, but I said nothing. I was to
light a fire if I saw a ship, but I knew it was you, and
I did nothing."</p>

<p>They had entered the house, and were safe from
observation.</p>

<p>"Isbel," said Floyd.</p>

<p>He held her apart from him for a moment; then he
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>She clung to him, holding him about the neck with
her naked arms, telling him in a broken voice and a
half whisper how she had waited and watched always
for him; how she had prayed to the sea to bring him
back, and the stars to light him on his way. Then
holding him from her she told, in short, hot sentences,
fierce as stabbing spears, of his danger.</p>

<p>A new ship had come into the lagoon only the day
before; a new man had joined Schumer, a terrible
man. They had talked last night, and she had listened.
No sooner had this strange man shown his
face than she suspected danger; he "carried danger
with him." So she had listened. They had not talked
in the house; they had gone together and sat by the
grove edge. She had crawled through the trees and
listened. At first she could not make out what they
said, they spoke in so low a tone; then, feeling safe
and forgetting caution, they spoke louder. Even still
she could seize upon nothing definite, as they spoke
in a general way as if about some prearranged plot,
but she gathered enough to know that Luckman had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
come to the island to wait for the man she loved, and
then, with the help of Schumer, or, more properly
speaking, the connivance of Schumer, to do away with
him.</p>

<p>As she told this her gaze seemed to turn inward,
as though she were looking at some mental picture,
and a long shudder ran through her as though from
some vibration of the soul. It was not the shudder
of fear or cold; it was the shudder of hate, and Floyd,
who had never seen it before, felt for a moment almost
afraid of Isbel. He recognized, and not for the
first time, that this being whom he loved belonged to
a world of which he knew little. She was a person
from another star, the child of another race. In her
love for him a whole unknown world was rushing to
meet him. It was this that completed her fascination
and made him, now heedless of Schumer's menace,
seize her to his heart and cover her face and throat
with burning kisses. Taking fire she returned them,
and then, holding him apart from her again, and still
speaking in those sentences, short and hot like stabbing
spears that have already tasted blood, she went
on to give him all that she had gathered and all that
she suspected. She knew for certain that Luckman
and Schumer were expecting Floyd, for they had mentioned
him by name, and she knew for certain that
they had designs upon the life of the man they were
expecting, and here lay her great grief; she could not
fathom the nature of their design. She had, however,
gathered enough to understand that the Kanaka
crew of the <i>Southern Cross</i> was to be brought ashore
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Floyd, "they are going to do away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
the schooner. Well, we will see. We will see which
of us is the cuter and which the stronger. Isbel, I
am not alone."</p>

<p>"How?" said Isbel, looking at him with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>"I have a friend with me."</p>

<p>"A friend!"</p>

<p>"Yes, a friend. Providence sent him, I think."
He began to tell her about Cardon, how he had met
him in the street in Sydney, how Cardon had joined
in the venture and was ready to assist against Schumer,
and how he was now on board the <i>Southern
Cross</i> awaiting developments.</p>

<p>He had reached this stage in his story when a
sound from outside made them both turn. It was
the sound of oars in rowlocks.</p>

<p>Floyd sprang to the door. A boat that had crossed
the lagoon from the fishing ground was within a few
yards of the beach. It was the boat bringing Schumer
from the fishing camp.</p>

<p>A man was seated beside Schumer in the stern
sheets. Was it Luckman?</p>

<p>If indeed it was Luckman, then Luckman was a
most formidable individual. This person seated beside
Schumer was immense, a great four-square built
man beside whom Schumer had the appearance of a
youth.</p>

<p>As the boat touched the sand Schumer leaped out,
and, half wading, made up the beach toward Floyd,
who had come down from the house. Isbel had remained
indoors.</p>

<p>"So you're back," cried Schumer, as he held out his
hand. "I knew nothing till half an hour ago over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
there at the fishing ground I turned my head and saw
the <i>Southern Cross</i> coming into the lagoon. Isbel
should have spotted her hours ago and given us a
signal. Oh, I forgot. I have a new man to introduce
you to, but you've seen his vessel; it ran in here
yesterday for water. It is the <i>Domain</i>, of Sydney,
owned by&mdash;who do you think?&mdash;Hakluyt, and here's
her captain; Luckman is his name. Luckman, this is
Mr. Floyd."</p>

<p>Just as Floyd held out his hand toward Luckman
a curious sensation struck him, as though for a moment
he were clairvoyant, as though for the hundredth
part of a moment some glimpse had been given him
of his psychic surroundings, a glimpse of the soul of
Schumer, of Luckman, and incidentally of Hakluyt.
It was Luckman's appearance, perhaps, that influenced
him.</p>

<p>Luckman, though a very big man at a distance, was
a very little man seen close to. In other words, he
had nothing to recommend him but his size. He had,
no doubt, been all that the barkeeper had hinted. He
had, no doubt, sunk ships in his time and lost the lives
of innumerable sailormen and escaped from the law
himself by a miracle. All the same, from the crown
of his flat head to the sole of his flat feet, the man
was a duffer, a mass of brute force&mdash;nothing more.
And the thing that struck Floyd most keenly at that
moment was the thought that Luckman, like himself,
was in the toils of Schumer and Hakluyt; that
Luckman might be used as a tool against him&mdash;Floyd&mdash;but
would be inevitably flung away when used by
Schumer and Hakluyt. That they would take the opportunity
not only of getting rid of the <i>Southern Cross</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
at a high insurance and of their troublesome partner,
but also of Luckman, their tool and assistant.</p>

<p>The fact that Schumer had taken Luckman to the
fishing ground and let him see the secret of the island
with his own eyes, that fact seemed to Floyd to be
Luckman's death sentence.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet you," said Luckman, holding out a
fist like a ham.</p>

<p>"It's funny that you should have turned up here,"
said Floyd, "for only a very little time ago I parted
with Mr. Hakluyt, your owner."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Luckman, "it's funny enough to see
two of Hakluyt's vessels in the same lagoon, considering
the many lagoons there are in the Pacific. I was
bound for Upolo, and was blown a bit out of my
course, then I picked up this island and put in for
water, and when Mr. Schumer here found Hakluyt
was my owner he <i>was</i> surprised&mdash;weren't you, Mr.
Schumer?"</p>

<p>He laughed as he asked the question, and Schumer
laughed as he replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"The strange thing is," said Floyd gravely, "that I
left Sydney, came straight down here, and here I find
the <i>Domain</i>, who has missed Upolo, which is a good
way out of the line, been blown out of her course,
and yet has arrived here only a day before me."</p>

<p>"And how is that strange?" asked Luckman.</p>

<p>"In this way: I saw the <i>Domain</i> in Sydney harbor
two days before I left, riding at her anchor. How
the deuce has she managed to go through all those
experiences you speak of and yet arrive here only the
day before me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>"And what date was it when you left Sydney?"
asked Luckman.</p>

<p>Floyd gave the date.</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say," said Luckman, "is that the
<i>Domain</i> left ten days before that. You must be thinking
of the <i>Dominion</i>, which is also owned by Hakluyt.
She's a sister of the <i>Domain</i>, built on the same slip,
owned by Shuster, she was, till he went bankrupt and
Hakluyt picked her up for an old song. That's the
vessel that's in your head. I left her anchored in
Sydney harbor when I left." Floyd said nothing.
Luckman's manner was so assured and plausible that
had he not overheard that fatal conversation in Hakluyt's
office he would have been entirely taken in. He
turned to Schumer as if to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "how has the luck been going?"</p>

<p>Schumer took him by the arm and led him away
a bit along the water edge.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are back," said he, "before that man
Luckman leaves. It's a nuisance, his coming. Of
course he's one of Hakluyt's men, else I'd have made
him clear out of the lagoon when he'd taken his water
on board. As it is he knows all about the pearling.
He scented it at once, and spoke to me of it. You
see, he's an old island hand, so I just told him, and,
what's more, took him right over the grounds. I did
a bit of trade with him, too. He had some timber
and corrugated iron on board, and I bought it of him,
and we've been rafting it over all yesterday and to-day.
I'm going to put up huts over at the fishing
camp. The rains will be here soon, now, and I want
to get the fellows under cover."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that so?" said Floyd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>He could not make out all this in the least, but he
determined to say nothing and wait for more indications.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Schumer, "it's most important for us
to keep these fellows fit and well, and tents aren't
much use against the rains, especially in an exposed
place like the grounds over there. Seems like Providence,
doesn't it, that fellow Luckman happening
along with his building material just at the moment?"</p>

<p>"Schumer," said Floyd, "are you sure it's all right
about Luckman?"</p>

<p>Schumer turned on him with a surprised look.
"Why, what could be wrong?"</p>

<p>"Well, I could have sworn I saw the <i>Domain</i> in
the harbor two days before I left."</p>

<p>"In Sydney harbor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in Sydney harbor."</p>

<p>"My dear chap," said Schumer, "you heard what
he said&mdash;what could be wrong? Even if Hakluyt
were to try to get the better of us in any way what
could Luckman do? Steal the pearls? Well, I reckon
he'd have his work cut out, considering we are two
to one. No. You have made a mistake. It was the
<i>Dominion</i> you saw. Mind you, I wouldn't trust Hakluyt
farther than I could see him, but it's against common
sense to think that he is trying to play any game
against us. You see, the crew of the <i>Domain</i> are all
Kanakas, and not fighting Kanakas, either, but a soft
lot; otherwise it might be different. Then again
Luckman is off to-morrow. Oh, you needn't be a bit
scared of Luckman; I'm sharp enough to smell a rat,
as you very well know, and I'm satisfied."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Floyd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>"Now as to the building business," went on Schumer,
"I want all the <i>Southern Cross</i> chaps to get to
work on it first thing to-morrow, so we may as well
get them over to the fishing camp to-night."</p>

<p>"To-night!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they'll be able to stretch their legs before setting
to, and they'll want to put up tents for themselves
while they are working."</p>

<p>"Very well. I can send them over in the whaleboat."</p>

<p>"That will do after supper," said Schumer.</p>

<p>The sun at this moment was just setting beyond the
reef, and a thin wreath of smoke was rising near the
grove where Isbel was busy lighting the fire and getting
supper ready. Luckman was seated on the sand,
near the house, smoking and seemingly oblivious to
everything but the beauty of the scene before him.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Southern Cross</i> were fraternizing
across the water with the crew of the <i>Domain</i>. Their
thin, high-pitched voices came across the lagoon water
and mixed with the crying of the gulls who were flocking
around the vessels, picking up scraps from the rubbish
that the fellows had hove overboard. Then, as
the sun sank, the crying of the gulls died down and
silence fell on the island with the night, a silence
only broken by the song of the surf and the blowing
of the night wind in the foliage of the grove.</p>

<p>Isbel, having prepared the meal, had disappeared,
and the three men found themselves alone by the
flickering camp fire. It was the night before the new
moon, and beyond the zone of firelight the lagoon
showed all shot with stars, and the two schooners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
gray black with their anchor lights shining in the twilight
of the stars.</p>

<p>Schumer had produced a bottle of wine in honor of
Luckman, but despite the wine and Schumer's attempts
at conviviality the talk hung fire.</p>

<p>Floyd was thinking hard.</p>

<p>Schumer's suggestion that the crew of the <i>Southern
Cross</i> should be landed over at the fishing beach was
plausible on the face of it. The men would work
better after a night on shore; they would be on the
spot in the morning, and so no time would be wasted
bringing them across the lagoon, and it was certainly
necessary that no time should be lost in putting up the
huts, if they were to be put up, for the rainy season
was fast approaching. All the same, he felt that
there was more in the proposition than what met the
eye.</p>

<p>He did not like the idea of being left alone here
with Schumer and Luckman. It was true that the
crew of the <i>Domain</i> would be on board their vessel,
but she was anchored a good way out. The conviction
came to him that whatever these two men had in
mind was to be carried out that night, and that the
<i>Southern Cross</i> would be the object of their plans as
well as himself. Most possibly they would sink her
at her anchorage after having disposed of him.</p>

<p>He determined, come what might, not to sleep
ashore, and as they were finishing supper he made up
his mind to state his intention at once.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I suppose I'd better get off and
send those fellows across to the camp. I'll give them
the whaleboat; it will hold the lot."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Schumer, "I'll come with you and start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
them off, and maybe you'd better sleep on board for
to-night, as I've put Captain Luckman up in the house
and there's only two beds."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll sleep aboard," said Floyd, relieved, yet
somewhat surprised at Schumer suggesting the very
plan that was in his mind. "I've got all my tackle
there, besides&mdash;well, shall we start?"</p>

<p>He looked round, on the chance of seeing Isbel, but
she was nowhere about; then they left Luckman,
smoking by the fire, and, going down to the lagoon
edge, pushed off the quarter boat which was lying by
the dinghy. They would have taken the dinghy, only
that she had developed a leak. Schumer explained
this as they rowed, and Floyd scarcely heard him;
he was thinking of Isbel.</p>

<p>He could not possibly take her off with him, and
she was safer ashore in the dangerous business that
he felt was developing. He had no fear of harm
coming to her left alone with Schumer and Luckman,
for she was well able to take care of herself, and she
was armed. She had told him so. All the same his
heart felt heavy as lead at leaving her, even though
they were separated only by a couple of cable lengths
of water.</p>

<p>On board, he gave orders to Mountain Joe for the
landing of the crew, and in a moment the deck was
swarming. The idea of getting ashore set the fellows
chattering and carrying on like school children just set
free, and there were no hands wanted to assist at the
falls.</p>

<p>In a moment the whaleboat was lowered and alongside
and the crew tumbling into her. Schumer helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
in the lowering of the boat and shouted directions to
Mountain Joe, who took the stern oar.</p>

<p>"They'll find canvas enough over there if they want
to make tents," said Schumer. "As like as not they
will prefer sleeping in the open on a night like this.
There they go."</p>

<p>The whaleboat had pushed off, and was now out in
the lagoon, making good way despite its heavy load.</p>

<p>It looked like a huge, heavy-bodied beetle crawling
across the surface of the lagoon.</p>

<p>Schumer turned away and followed Floyd down
to the cabin for a drink. Floyd had shipped some Bitter
Water at Sydney, and he opened a bottle now
and produced glasses from the swinging rack by the
door. He also brought out a box of cigars.</p>

<p>Schumer took a cigar and a drink, and sat down at
the table, placing his hat upon it.</p>

<p>Floyd took his place opposite to him, and they sat
smoking and talking on indifferent matters, Floyd
trying to keep pace with the situation and at the same
time to appear his ordinary self.</p>

<p>Should he deal with Schumer now and at once or
let him go ashore and then have a consultation with
Cardon?</p>

<p>Cardon, he knew, was listening to every word of
their conversation, and he had a great respect for
Cardon's judgment. He determined to explain the
situation to Cardon now and at once and through his
conversation with Schumer.</p>

<p>"It was a good idea of yours to send all the crew
ashore at the fishing camp so as to have them on the
spot for working in the morning," said he. "Of
course that only leaves me on board, and I'm a jolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
sight too tired to stand an anchor watch. However,
we don't want an anchor watch in this lagoon. There's
nothing to look out for but sharks."</p>

<p>"That's so," replied Schumer.</p>

<p>"Luckman is off to-morrow, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he'll be off to-morrow if this wind holds."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad to have met him. He didn't give
me a very good impression at first sight, but he improves
a bit on acquaintance. He must be a powerfully
strong man. I'd sooner have him at my back in
a fight than against me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Schumer, "I reckon he could hold his
own against any two men, or maybe three, but he's all
strength, not much intelligence."</p>

<p>"And it's the intelligence that counts nowadays,"
said Floyd. "You see, if a man has a gun and some
intelligence, brute force doesn't count for much, or
even numbers. I had an adventure once that proved
that to me. I was held up in the cabin of a ship by
two ruffians&mdash;it was off the South American coast&mdash;and
I didn't resist simply for the reason that a friend
of mine was close by whom I reckoned to be a much
cleverer chap than myself. He was lying in his bunk,
and the fellows couldn't see him. I waited for his
lead. His name was Cardon, and I determined to let
him decide whether I should put up a fight at once or
just sit still and let myself be robbed. It was the funniest
sensation, sitting there and waiting for another
man's brains to work out the situation, but I was right.
The upshot was I recovered my money." He yawned,
and then suddenly, switching off the subject: "There's
no fear, is there, of Luckman getting too close to the
pearls? Mind you, I'm not going against your judg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>ment
about the man. All the same, temptation is
temptation, and it's as well to be on our guard."</p>

<p>"The pearls are all right," said Schumer. "They
are in the safe, and the safe is in the inner room of
the house, and I sleep there."</p>

<p>He rose to go, flicking the ash of his cigar onto
the floor. Floyd rose also.</p>

<p>There was no sign from Cardon, so he knew that
wily person had decided to let Schumer go ashore.
Then he accompanied the other on deck.</p>

<p>The boat in which Schumer had come was
alongside. He got into it, bade Floyd good night, and
rowed ashore. Floyd watched him land. He saw
Luckman come down from the house to help in beaching
the boat, and then the two men walked up to the
house. They entered it, and closed the door, and then
beach and reef and grove lay deserted under the starlight.</p>

<p>Floyd left the deck and came down to the cabin,
and there, at the table, Cardon was seated.</p>

<p>"You've done well," said Cardon. "I was afraid
you would open the game too soon. Sit down there
and give me a few points. What's Luckman like?"</p>

<p>"Like a beast," said Floyd.</p>

<p>"I heard all you said," went on Cardon. "Schumer
has got all the men off the ship, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's their first move, and they mean business
to-night&mdash;when you are sleeping. They won't act for
an hour or two yet, so we have plenty of time."</p>

<p>"What's their game, do you think?" asked Floyd.</p>

<p>"It's as simple as sin. They mean to row off, steal
down here, knock you on the head, and then scuttle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the schooner. They'll reckon to take you sleeping.
That's their game, and as like as not, when the business
is done, Schumer will do Luckman in and sink
him with the ship."</p>

<p>"Good God!" said Floyd. "I was thinking that
myself to-night, and yet you who have never seen
Schumer suspected it, too."</p>

<p>"Simply because I have studied out the whole proposition
while I was lying in that stuffy bunk. Can't
you see how it stands? They must get rid of Luckman.
The only thing that gravels me is this: Why
did they ever bring Luckman into the affair at all?
Why didn't Schumer knock you on the head, do the
thing off his own bat, so to speak?</p>

<p>"I can only work it out like this: If he had done
that there would have been witnesses sure. The crew
of the <i>Southern Cross</i> would have smelled a rat.
There's nothing more likely to pop out than murder
if there are any witnesses that know the murdered
party. Schumer wants to break off from the island
and every one connected with the pearling. Most
likely he suspects the lagoon is beginning to give out.
Anyhow, he has got a big lot of stuff, and it's my
belief that his plan is to cut his stick instantly you
are out of the way, leave the island and the lagoon
and the niggers to look after themselves, and set sail
in the <i>Domain</i> with the boodle he's got. That's why
he has landed the crew."</p>

<p>"You mean to say he will desert the island and
never come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But surely if he did a thing like that it would only
mean losing a good property. I don't believe the la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>goon
is giving out. There was no indication of it."</p>

<p>"I only suggested that. It may be giving out or
it mayn't, but there's this fact, you must admit&mdash;the
lagoon is not real estate; you have no title to it. Suppose
an English man-of-war shoves her nose in and
asks you what you are doing here. What will you
say? That you are looking for mushrooms? English,
French, or German, the first ship that gets wind
of the business does for you. They'll mark it down
on their chart and say to you: 'This is our island;
get out!' Suppose even a trader comes along and
sniffs you. Do you think they're going to leave a jeweler's
shop like this severely alone? Do you think
they won't say 'half shares or we split'? No, sir.
You and Schumer have had a very good swig at this
cornucopia. It's amazing you haven't been interfered
with before this. The common-sense thing is to take
what you've got and do a bunk, cut all connections with
the business, and don't leave a rag of yourselves behind.
That's what Schumer is going to do. Of
course he'll have to play fair with Hakluyt so as to
get rid of the pearls and have no trouble about the
schooner. Then there's the insurance money on the
<i>Southern Cross</i>. That will be a nice penny for them
to divide."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," said Floyd. "It's hateful&mdash;the
whole thing. The world seems suddenly to
be filled with devils, not men. I could never have
fancied such villainy if I hadn't gone through it."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be pretty tough to this sort of thing
when you are as old as I am," said Cardon, "and
when you have knocked about the west American seaboard
a dozen years or so. You don't know these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
chaps as I do. A sailor doesn't know anything. You
must leave the sea and stick for a few years to the
land as I have done to find the truth, and the truth
about the Pacific coast is that quite a lot of people
don't give a cent for the life of a man if it's worth a
dollar to them.</p>

<p>"Now, there's no use in sticking down here any
longer. We'd better be getting up on deck and taking
our position. I've got a plan in my head which you'll
see put in work before long. Have you got your
gun?"</p>

<p>Floyd showed the butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>"Right!" said Cardon. "And now, first of all, let's
make everything straight."</p>

<p>There were three glasses on the table, his own,
Floyd's, and the one Schumer had drunk from. He
renewed his own glass, looked round to make sure
that he had left no trace of his presence anywhere,
put out the light, and led the way on deck.</p>

<p>At the top of the companionway he turned to
Floyd, who was below him.</p>

<p>"Don't show yourself above the bulwarks," said he.
"Crawl along the deck after me to the caboose.
That's the place for us to hide and wait for them."</p>

<p>"Right!" said Floyd.</p>

<p>They crawled along on hands and knees till they
reached the caboose door. It opened to the starboard,
and as the <i>Southern Cross</i> was swinging to the incoming
tide, with her nose to the break in the reef, the
door of the caboose faced the <i>Domain</i>, and consequently
could not be seen from the shore.</p>

<p>Cardon opened the door, and they went in, closing
the door behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>The place was terribly stuffy and filled with the
smell of grease and cooking. The copper was still
hot, which did not improve matters, and cockroaches
were in evidence even in that darkness.</p>

<p>There was a scuttle giving aft, and in a moment
Floyd had opened it. It gave a view of the whole
of the deck aft, and though there was no moon the
starlight showed everything. The main hatch, with
its cover of tarpaulin, the saloon hatch, the bulwarks,
and the planking of the deck so clearly that the lines
of division between the planks could be traced, and
even the dowels that fixed the planking to the beams.</p>

<p>It was a noisome hole to be cooped up in, but it
was a splendid post of observation, though, from the
size of the scuttle, only one man could keep a lookout
at a time.</p>

<p>"We'll take it turn about," said Cardon, "and the
chap that's off duty can sit on the copper and keep it
warm. We haven't a watch, and a watch would be
no use to us, as we daren't show a light; so we'll have
to guess the length of the trick. Ten minutes each
will be the length of the lookout as far as we can
make it. I'll take first, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Floyd had no objection, and he sat on a ledge by
the copper, listening and waiting in the dark while
Cardon stood on watch. The ship was full of sounds.
On deck everything seemed bathed in dead silence,
but here, listening in the dark, all sorts of little noises
came to greet the ear and imagination.</p>

<p>The outside sea sent a vague, almost imperceptible,
swell into the lagoon, and as she moved to it she
creaked and muttered and groaned, masts, spars, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
body timber all finding points of greater and lesser
tension and every point a tiny voice.</p>

<p>The rudder shifted now and then slightly, and the
rudder chain clicked in response. There were rats
on board, and they made themselves audible, and there
was a nest of young rats somewhere under the planking,
and their thriddy voices came in little bursts now
and then, telling of some disturbance in the nest.
Floyd pictured to himself the old mother rat suckling
them while the father was out on business seeking
food, and he philosophized on the idea that even the
timbers of a ship may hide all sorts of interests and
ambitions, affections and hates.</p>

<p>An hour passed, during which he and Cardon relieved
each other at the lookout post several times,
and it was during Cardon's watch, some twenty minutes
later, that the event occurred.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sound made itself heard that was not
a sound born of the ship. A faint splash came from
alongside, followed by something quite unmistakable&mdash;the
sound of an oar shipped and laid along the seats
of a boat&mdash;incautiously. It had probably slipped
from the hand of the rower as he laid it inboard.</p>

<p>Floyd, who had heard the sound also, tipped Cardon's
leg with his toe, and Cardon, reaching out with
his heel, signaled that he knew.</p>

<p>A few seconds passed, and then Cardon saw a form
coming over the side. It was Schumer. He had
never seen Schumer, but from Floyd's description he
knew that it could not be Luckman. Then, surely
enough, came Luckman in all his immensity.</p>

<p>Neither man wore either boots or stockings, and
their bare feet, wet with the bilge water of the boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
shone in the starlight. Those glistening feet fascinated
Cardon. All the tragedy of the business seemed
focused in them, and, strong and brave though he
was, they exercised such a powerful psychological effect
that for a moment he could have retched.</p>

<p>The two men did not pause for more than a second.
Soundless as shadows, they made for the saloon hatch,
while Cardon, who thought the moment for action
had arrived, moved slightly as if to leave his post.</p>

<p>Then he stopped.</p>

<p>Schumer and his companion, instead of going down
below, were bending over the hatch. They were closing
it.</p>

<p>Cardon drew in his breath.</p>

<p>He saw at once their object. Instead of going
down to kill the man they imagined to be below, they
were bottling him up. No man, however strong,
could force his way on deck through that hatch once
closed.</p>

<p>Again he felt Floyd's toe, as if it were inquiring if
all was right, and, again reaching back, he signaled
an answer. His eyes were glued to the malefactors,
who were now at the main hatch removing the
tarpaulin.</p>

<p>It did not take long. Then they worked the locking
bars loose and removed the hatch with scarcely a
sound. He saw Schumer produce something. It was
a lantern. They lit it, and Schumer, with it in his
hand, vanished down the main hatch into the hold.
He was there a full minute that seemed a full hour
to the man at the scuttle; then he reappeared. The
hatch was closed, but the tarpaulin was not replaced,
and, leaving it, they came forward, Schumer carrying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
the light and Luckman following him. They passed
the caboose, and were lost to sight.</p>

<p>"Now is our time," whispered Cardon, turning
from the scuttle. "We've got them forward in a close
space. Cock your gun and follow me."</p>

<p>He opened the caboose door and found a vacant
deck.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought that the two men had
gone overboard; then he saw the truth. They had
gone down into the fo'c'sle. Floyd saw the situation
and the chance in the same flash with Cardon, and in
a moment they had flung themselves on the fo'c'sle
hatch cover and driven it to.</p>

<p>The men who fancied they had bottled Floyd were
bottled in their turn.</p>

<p>They had imagined a vain thing, and the fact was
evidently borne in on them now to judge from the
sounds coming from below.</p>

<p>The cover of the fo'c'sle hatch was placed at such
an angle with the fo'c'sle companionway that it was
impossible to make much noise by striking upward
from below, and its thickness was well demonstrated
by the feebleness of the noise of the men who were
now shouting at the top of their voices.</p>

<p>"They're fixed and done for," said Cardon, "and
I reckon Schumer will start repenting in a minute that
he sent the crew ashore. Come, we have no time to
waste here."</p>

<p>He ran to the port rail, followed by Floyd.</p>

<p>The boat Schumer and Luckman had come in was
alongside. Every plan they had made and every
preparation seemed working now for their destruction
and for the success of their enemies. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
thought crossed Floyd's mind as he followed Cardon
down into the boat, but there was little time to think
in, and, taking the stern oar while Cardon took the
bow, they pushed off for the shore.</p>

<p>Having beached the boat, Floyd led the way up
to the house, and as they approached it a figure came
out of the grove into the starlight. It was Isbel.
Floyd ran up to her as Cardon entered the house;
then, as he was holding her hands and trying to tell
her all that had occurred, Cardon appeared at the
house door with a lighted match in his hand.</p>

<p>"There's no safe here," said he.</p>

<p>He lit another match as they followed through the
main into the inner room.</p>

<p>There was nothing there at all, except the bed
which Schumer slept on and the tossed blankets. The
safe, which had stood in one corner of the room, was
gone.</p>

<p>"That does us," said Floyd. He had fancied that
the pearls were a secondary consideration, that Isbel
was the one and only thing. Now he knew different.
Isbel was not the only thing. Without the pearls and
the money they would fetch he was nothing. Nothing
but a sailorman earning a few shillings a week, tossed
hither and thither about the world at the will of an
owner.</p>

<p>For one terrible minute before the loss of these
things he felt his poverty, and there is nothing much
more terrible than that if one loves. What had
stricken him would strike Isbel. Where could he take
her? What could he do with her, he who had no
home but a sailors' lodging home, no resources but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
a miserable pittance only to be earned at the cost of
separation from her?</p>

<p>Cardon brought him back to himself.</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't," said Cardon, "but it saves us a
lot of trouble. Can't you see? The pearls and the
safe are on board the <i>Domain</i>?"</p>

<p>"On board the <i>Domain</i>?"</p>

<p>"Where else? Didn't I tell you Schumer was going
to shin out of here in the <i>Domain</i>? Well, he
has removed the safe there, and all we have to do
now is to go aboard the <i>Domain</i>, up anchor, and get
away. He has played into our hands all through, and
every point he made against us has turned against him.
Don't you see?"</p>

<p>Floyd did. This last act of Schumer's put the finishing
touch to the business. Not only had he saved
them the trouble of carrying off the safe, but he had
destroyed all qualms in the mind of Floyd. All Schumer's
plotting, so skillful, so carefully weighed, so intricate,
and so powerfully backed by Hakluyt with his
ships and money had been brought to naught by one
little flaw, one accident&mdash;Floyd's surprisal of Hakluyt's
conversation with Luckman.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Cardon.</p>

<p>They hurriedly left the house, Cardon walking first,
Floyd following with Isbel, whose hand he was holding.</p>

<p>It was their good-by to the island. In that short
walk from the house door to the lagoon edge the
fact that he was leaving what he nevermore might see
was brought vividly to the mind of Floyd. Never
had the place seemed more beautiful from the piers of
the reef to the far-off fires, where the pearl fishers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
were holding a revel beneath the palm trees with the
crew of the <i>Southern Cross</i>.</p>

<p>As they rowed across the lagoon, passing under the
stern of the <i>Southern Cross</i>, they could hear the songs
brought by the wind across the water from the fishing
camp. Not a sound came from the schooner, where
the trapped men were no doubt fumbling in the fo'c'sle
for some means of escape, and not a sound came from
the <i>Domain</i>, where the whole crew, anchor watch included,
were fast asleep. As they came alongside the
<i>Domain</i>, Cardon hailed her, and a fellow rousing on
deck came to the bulwark rail, rubbing his eyes. He
cast a rope, and the boat was made fast.</p>

<p>Then they came on board.</p>

<p>Three men had been sleeping on deck, the bos'n and
two of the hands, and when Cardon gave the order to
rouse the crew and get the anchor up just for a moment
it seemed there was going to be trouble. Then
Isbel saved the situation.</p>

<p>"It is by Luckman's orders," said she, speaking in
the native. "He is staying here; the ship is to be
taken where he wills," she finished, pointing at Cardon.
Had there been any resistance on the part of
the bos'n or the crew Cardon would have promptly
dealt with it, but there was none. They were an unsuspicious
lot. There had been no sign of disturbance
on shore, and whether the ship sail under Luckman
or under Cardon did not matter a button to them.
Besides, it was due to sail. The water was on board,
and Luckman had told them to be ready to weigh
anchor at any moment.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing steadily for the break in the
reef, and now, had you been ashore, you would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
seen the mainsail of the <i>Domain</i> rising like a black
wing under the stars to the creaking of blocks and
slatting of canvas; then came the sound of the capstan
pawls as the anchor chain was hove short, and
Floyd's voice ordering the jib to be cast loose. The
tide was near the turn, and it was just approaching
the moment of smooth water at the reef opening.</p>

<p>Floyd, before starting to work the vessel, had run
down to the cabin, where, sure enough, the safe was
standing against the couch which ran along the starboard
side, and between it and the table.</p>

<p>Not only was the safe on board, but Schumer had
also brought off the tin cash box holding what remained
to them of the money of the <i>Cormorant</i> and
<i>Tonga</i>.</p>

<p>He had made a clean sweep, only to sweep it all
into Floyd's pocket.</p>

<p>Floyd was thinking this as he stood on deck now
giving orders for the securing of the anchor which
had left the water and was being hoisted, dripping,
to the catheads, and now as the mainsail filled to the
wind he took the wheel himself.</p>

<p>As he turned the spokes and got the feel of the ship
answering to his hand a faint, hot, acrid smell came
on a puff of wind, a smell of burning, though from
where he could not say. He glanced back at the far-off
fires of the fishing camp, and fancied it might be
coming from that quarter. There was nowhere else
possible for it to come from except the <i>Southern
Cross</i>, and the <i>Southern Cross</i> showed no sign of
smoke or fire as she lay there mute and somber, her
spars cutting the starlit sky and her hull blackening
with its shadow the starlit water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>So gently did the <i>Domain</i> move that, viewed from
the deck, it seemed that past her, lying stationary, the
reef and the trees were gliding aft.</p>

<p>Then the pierheads of the reef passed like ghosts
or shadows, and the <i>Domain</i> rose to the swell of the
outer sea and sank, bursting the foam away from her
bow like snow.</p>

<p>Floyd gave the wheel over to the bos'n, and stood
for a moment looking aft across the sea; then he
turned and went below, where Isbel was waiting for
him in the cabin.</p>

<div class="gap-25"></div>

<p>Cardon, left on deck, paced up and down, now with
an eye on the binnacle card, now glancing aft, as
though on the watch for something he expected to
appear in the wake of the schooner.</p>

<p>The wind had freshened, and the <i>Domain</i> was
making a good eight knots. Not a cloud was to be
seen in the star-spangled sky, nor a sail on the sea
line, nor a sign now of the island.</p>

<p>The atoll island does not show up well at night.
It is less an island than a kink in the sea over which
a vessel may trip just as a man trips over a kink in a
carpet, and, looking back now as Cardon was looking,
nothing could be seen of the shore they had left.</p>

<p>Till suddenly Cardon drew in his breath, clutched
the after rail, and stood motionless and gazing at a
pale orange-colored glow marking the sky on the sea
line they were leaving.</p>

<p>Even as he watched the glow deepened in color to
an angry red.</p>

<p>A great fire was in progress over there. One might
have fancied that the whole of Pearl Island had caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
alight and was blazing like a torch in the wind. But
Cardon knew better. He knew that what he was
watching was the destruction of the <i>Southern Cross</i>.</p>

<p>When he had seen Schumer going down into the
hold with the light he had guessed what was forward.
Schumer had fired the vessel, and then, to
make sure, he had gone into the fo'c'sle with Luckman
to fire her in a fresh place.</p>

<p>The fire had proclaimed itself now, and Schumer
and his companion, bottled up in the fo'c'sle, would by
this be beyond praying for.</p>

<p>Cardon had said nothing to Floyd of his suspicions,
and now as he watched them verified he determined
to keep the matter still to himself.</p>

<p>There was no use in troubling the mind of Floyd.
As for his own mind, he was not in the least troubled.</p>

<p>What Schumer had prepared for another he was
receiving himself, and Cardon was not the man to pity
a traitor and a murderer or to quarrel with the justice
of fate.</p>

<p>But it was strange beyond imagination to watch
that steady, silent, distant glow, knowing what it
meant.</p>

<p>He watched it increasing to a certain point and decrease
to a certain point. Of a sudden, with a heave
and flicker, it went out, and the stars burned clear
where the glow had been.</p>

<p>The <i>Southern Cross</i> had sunk at her anchorage, and
Cardon, turning away, left the deck and came down
to the cabin where Floyd and the girl were seated.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">ENVOI</h2></div>

<p>Some three weeks later the <i>Domain</i> cast anchor in
Sydney harbor, and Cardon, after the port authorities
and the health officer had been on board, took a shore
boat for the quay. Floyd and Isbel did not accompany
him. He was going to interview Hakluyt, and
he judged that he would do the business better if he
did it alone.</p>

<p>He waved his hand to them as he rowed off, and
when he reached the quay he made straight for Hakluyt's
office.</p>

<p>Hakluyt was in, but was engaged, and Cardon
waited in an outer room patiently enough for some
twenty minutes. He was in no hurry, and when at
last he was shown into the room where the shipowner
was seated at his desk he showed no hurry to begin
the business he had on hand.</p>

<p>He was studying Hakluyt.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Hakluyt, after the pause that followed
Cardon's announcement and while that person
was comfortably taking his seat, "and what can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Cardon. "I have come to tell you
that Luckman has burned the <i>Southern Cross</i>, according
to arrangement with you, and that I have all the
evidence in my pocket, that he tried to do away with
Mr. Floyd according to agreement, and that I have
witnesses of the plot. In other words, my dear man,
that your game is up and that it rests entirely with me
whether I close my fist on you or let you go free."</p>

<p>Hakluyt said nothing.</p>

<p>"All your pearls are gone," said Cardon, lighting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
cigarette. "Floyd has got them. They are worth
a good many thousand. I have taken your schooner,
the <i>Domain</i>, and you have here and now to make out
a paper selling her to me for the sum of&mdash;shall we
say five thousand?&mdash;not one penny of which you will
ever receive. I am going to take her to 'Frisco, and
if you make one kick or give one squeal or try one
dirty trick I will put you in quod as sure as my name
is Jack Cardon."</p>

<p>"This is blackmail," said Hakluyt, sweating and
grinning at the same time, and in all his life Cardon
had never seen anything stranger than that grin.</p>

<p>"This is blackmail!"</p>

<p>"Of course it is," replied the other, "but what I
want to point out to you is that there is no resistance.
You are absolutely tied up. I have Luckman and
Schumer in the hollow, of my hand, a whole island
full of Kanaka witnesses, <i>and</i> the sunken schooner;
also Floyd and a native girl. Well, what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"Where is Schumer?" cried Hakluyt, who seemed
now like a person dazed by a blow.</p>

<p>"He's with Luckman, and I can only say this&mdash;he
can be produced when wanted." Then, suddenly
bursting out: "He is where you sent him. Dead in
the fo'c'sle of the ship that he sank. He, and
Luckman along with him. Blackmail! Do you think if I
were working this thing for my own hand I would
stoop to blackmail <i>you</i>? No, sir. I'm working this
for Floyd, who is a soft-shell Englishman, as good as
they make them, but a child against ruffians of your
cut. I'm squeezing you for him, and if you don't like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
my loving embrace say so and I'll call in the law to do
the business. Now I give you one minute to decide.
Do you stick out or do you give in?"</p>

<p>"I give in," said Hakluyt.</p>

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
